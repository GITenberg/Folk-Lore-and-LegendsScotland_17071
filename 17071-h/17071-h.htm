<h2><!-- page v--><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>
<p>The distinctive features of Scotch Folk-lore are such as might have
been expected from a consideration of the characteristics of Scotch
scenery.&nbsp; The rugged grandeur of the mountain, the solemn influence
of the widespreading moor, the dark face of the deep mountain loch,
the babbling of the little stream, seem all to be reflected in the popular
tales and superstitions.&nbsp; The acquaintance with nature in a severe,
grand, and somewhat terrible form must necessarily have its effect on
the human mind, and the Scotch mind and character bear the impress of
their natural surroundings.&nbsp; The fairies, the brownies, the bogles
of Scotland are the same beings as those with whom the Irish have peopled
the hills, the nooks, and the streams of their land, yet how different,
how distinguished from their counterparts, how clothed, as it were,
in the national dress!</p>
<h2><!-- page 1--><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CANOBIE DICK AND
THOMAS OF ERCILDOUN.</h2>
<p>Now it chanced many years since that there lived on the Borders a
jolly rattling horse-cowper, who was remarkable for a reckless and fearless
temper, which made him much admired and a little dreaded amongst his
neighbours.&nbsp; One moonlight night, as he rode over Bowden Moor,
on the west side of the Eildon Hills, the scene of Thomas the Rhymer&rsquo;s
prophecies, and often mentioned in his history, having a brace of horses
along with him, which he had not been able to dispose of, he met a man
of venerable appearance and singularly antique dress, who, to his great
surprise, asked the price of his horses, and began to chaffer with him
on the subject.&nbsp; To Canobie Dick, for so shall we call our Border
dealer, a chap was a chap, and he would have sold a horse to the devil
himself, without minding his cloven hoof, and would have probably cheated
Old Nick into the bargain.&nbsp; The stranger paid the price they agreed
on, and all that puzzled Dick in the transaction was, that the gold
which he received was <!-- page 2--><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>in
unicorns, bonnet-pieces, and other ancient coins, which would have been
invaluable to collectors, but were rather troublesome in modern currency.&nbsp;
It was gold, however, and therefore Dick contrived to get better value
for the coin than he perhaps gave to his customer.&nbsp; By the command
of so good a merchant, he brought horses to the same spot more than
once; the purchaser only stipulating that he should always come by night
and alone.&nbsp; I do not know whether it was from mere curiosity, or
whether some hope of gain mixed with it, but after Dick had sold several
horses in this way, he began to complain that dry bargains were unlucky,
and to hint, that since his chap must live in the neighbourhood, he
ought, in the courtesy of dealing, to treat him to half a mutchkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may see my dwelling if you will,&rdquo; said the stranger;
&ldquo;but if you lose courage at what you see there, you will rue it
all your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dickon, however, laughed the warning to scorn, and having alighted
to secure his horse, he followed the stranger up a narrow footpath,
which led them up the hills to the singular eminence stuck betwixt the
most southern and the centre peaks, and called, from its resemblance
to such an animal in its form, the Lucken Hare.&nbsp; At the foot of
this eminence, which is almost as famous for witch-meetings as the neighbouring
windmill of Kippilaw, Dick was somewhat startled to observe that his
conductor entered <!-- page 3--><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the
hillside by a passage or cavern, of which he himself, though well acquainted
with the spot, had never seen nor heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may still return,&rdquo; said his guide, looking ominously
back upon him; but Dick scorned to show the white feather, and on they
went.&nbsp; They entered a very long range of stables; in every stall
stood a coal-black horse; by every horse lay a knight in coal-black
armour, with a drawn sword in his hand; but all were as silent, hoof
and limb, as if they had been cut out of marble.&nbsp; A great number
of torches lent a gloomy lustre to the hall, which, like those of the
Caliph Vathek, was of large dimensions.&nbsp; At the upper end, however,
they at length arrived, where a sword and horn lay on an antique table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that shall sound that horn and draw that sword,&rdquo;
said the stranger, who now intimated that he was the famous Thomas of
Ercildoun, &ldquo;shall, if his heart fail him not, be king over all
broad Britain.&nbsp; So speaks the tongue that cannot lie.&nbsp; But
all depends on courage, and much on your taking the sword or horn first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was much disposed to take the sword, but his bold spirit was
quailed by the supernatural terrors of the hall, and he thought to unsheathe
the sword first might be construed into defiance, and give offence to
the powers of the mountain.&nbsp; He took the bugle with a trembling
hand, and blew a <!-- page 4--><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>feeble
note, but loud enough to produce a terrible answer.&nbsp; Thunder rolled
in stunning peals through the immense hall; horses and men started to
life; the steeds snorted, stamped, ground their bits, and tossed their
heads; the warriors sprang to their feet, clashed their armour, and
brandished their swords.&nbsp; Dick&rsquo;s terror was extreme at seeing
the whole army, which had been so lately silent as the grave, in uproar,
and about to rush on him.&nbsp; He dropped the horn, and made a feeble
attempt to seize the enchanted sword; but at the same moment a voice
pronounced aloud the mysterious words&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Woe to the coward, that ever he was born,<br />
Who did not draw the sword before he blew the horn!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time a whirlwind of irresistible fury howled through
the long hall, bore the unfortunate horse-jockey clear out of the mouth
of the cavern, and precipitated him over a steep bank of loose stones,
where the shepherds found him the next morning, with just breath sufficient
to tell his fearful tale, after concluding which he expired.</p>
<h2><!-- page 5--><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>COINNACH OER.</h2>
<p>Coinnach Oer, which means Dun Kenneth, was a celebrated man in his
generation.&nbsp; He has been called the Isaiah of the North.&nbsp;
The prophecies of this man are very frequently alluded to and quoted
in various parts of the Highlands; although little is known of the man
himself, except in Ross-shire.&nbsp; He was a small farmer in Strathpeffer,
near Dingwall, and for many years of his life neither exhibited any
talents, nor claimed any intelligence above his fellows.&nbsp; The manner
in which he obtained the prophetic gift was told by himself in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>As he was one day at work in the hill casting (digging) peats, he
heard a voice which seemed to call to him out of the air.&nbsp; It commanded
him to dig under a little green knoll which was near, and to gather
up the small white stones which he would discover beneath the turf.&nbsp;
The voice informed him, at the same time, that while he kept these stones
in his possession, he should be endued with the power of supernatural
foreknowledge.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Kenneth, though greatly
alarmed at this aerial conversation, followed the directions of his
invisible instructor, and turning up the turf on the hillock, in a little
time discovered the talismans.&nbsp; From that day forward, the mind
of Kenneth was illuminated by gleams of unearthly light; and he made
many predictions, of which the credulity of the people, and the coincidence
of accident, often supplied confirmation; and he certainly became the
most notable of the Highland prophets.&nbsp; The most remarkable and
well known of his vaticinations is the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Whenever
a M&rsquo;Lean with long hands, a Fraser with a black spot on his face,
a M&rsquo;Gregor with a black knee, and a club-footed M&rsquo;Leod of
Raga, shall have existed; whenever there shall have been successively
three M&rsquo;Donalds of the name of John, and three M&rsquo;Kinnons
of the same Christian name,&mdash;oppressors will appear in the country,
and the people will change their own land for a strange one.&rdquo;&nbsp;
All these personages have appeared since; and it is the common opinion
of the peasantry, that the consummation of the prophecy was fulfilled,
when the exaction of the exorbitant rents reduced the Highlanders to
poverty, and the introduction of the sheep banished the people to America.</p>
<p>Whatever might have been the gift of Kenneth Oer, he does not appear
to have used it with an extraordinary degree of discretion; and the
last time he <!-- page 7--><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>exercised
it, he was very near paying dear for his divination.</p>
<p>On this occasion he happened to be at some high festival of the M&rsquo;Kenzies
at Castle Braan.&nbsp; One of the guests was so exhilarated by the scene
of gaiety, that he could not forbear an eulogium on the gallantry of
the feast, and the nobleness of the guests.&nbsp; Kenneth, it appears,
had no regard for the M&rsquo;Kenzies, and was so provoked by this sally
in their praise, that he not only broke out into a severe satire against
their whole race, but gave vent to the prophetic denunciation of wrath
and confusion upon their posterity.&nbsp; The guests being informed
(or having overheard a part) of this rhapsody, instantly rose up with
one accord to punish the contumely of the prophet.&nbsp; Kenneth, though
he foretold the fate of others, did not in any manner look into that
of himself; for this reason, being doubtful of debating the propriety
of his prediction upon such unequal terms, he fled with the greatest
precipitation.&nbsp; The M&rsquo;Kenzies followed with infinite zeal;
and more than one ball had whistled over the head of the seer before
he reached Loch Ousie.&nbsp; The consequences of this prediction so
disgusted Kenneth with any further exercise of his prophetic calling,
that, in the anguish of his flight, he solemnly renounced all communication
with its power; and, as he ran along the margin of Loch Ousie, he took
out the wonderful pebbles, and cast them in a fury <!-- page 8--><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>into
the water.&nbsp; Whether his evil genius had now forsaken him, or his
condition was better than that of his pursuers, is unknown, but certain
it is, Kenneth, after the sacrifice of the pebbles, outstripped his
enraged enemies, and never, so far as I have heard, made any attempt
at prophecy from the hour of his escape.</p>
<p>Kenneth Oer had a son, who was called Ian Dubh Mac Coinnach (Black
John, the son of Kenneth), and lived in the village of Miltoun, near
Dingwall.&nbsp; His chief occupation was brewing whisky; and he was
killed in a fray at Miltoun, early in the present century.&nbsp; His
exit would not have formed the catastrophe of an epic poem, and appears
to have been one of those events of which his father had no intelligence,
for it happened in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>Having fallen into a dispute with a man with whom he had previously
been on friendly terms, they proceeded to blows; in the scuffle, the
boy, the son of Ian&rsquo;s adversary, observing the two combatants
locked in a close and firm gripe of eager contention, and being doubtful
of the event, ran into the house and brought out the iron pot-crook,
with which he saluted the head of the unfortunate Ian so severely, that
he not only relinquished his combat, but departed this life on the ensuing
morning.</p>
<h2><!-- page 9--><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>ELPHIN IRVING.</h2>
<blockquote><p>THE FAIRIES&rsquo; CUPBEARER.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady kilted her kirtle green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A little aboon her knee,<br />
The lady snooded her yellow hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A little aboon her bree,<br />
And she&rsquo;s gane to the good greenwood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fast as she could hie.</p>
<p>And first she let the black steed pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And syne she let the brown,<br />
And then she flew to the milk-white steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pulled the rider down:<br />
Syne out then sang the queen o&rsquo; the fairies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frae midst a bank of broom,<br />
She that has won him, young Tamlane,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has gotten a gallant groom.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Old Ballad</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The romantic vale of Corriewater, in Annandale, is regarded
by the inhabitants, a pastoral and unmingled people, as the last border
refuge of those beautiful and capricious beings, the fairies.&nbsp;
Many old people yet living imagine they have had intercourse of good
words and good deeds with the &lsquo;good folk&rsquo;; and continue
to tell that in the ancient <!-- page 10--><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>days
the fairies danced on the hill, and revelled in the glen, and showed
themselves, like the mysterious children of the deity of old, among
the sons and daughters of men.&nbsp; Their visits to the earth were
periods of joy and mirth to mankind, rather than of sorrow and apprehension.&nbsp;
They played on musical instruments of wonderful sweetness and variety
of note, spread unexpected feasts, the supernatural flavour of which
overpowered on many occasions the religious scruples of the Presbyterian
shepherds, performed wonderful deeds of horsemanship, and marched in
midnight processions, when the sound of their elfin minstrelsy charmed
youths and maidens into love for their persons and pursuits; and more
than one family of Corriewater have the fame of augmenting the numbers
of the elfin chivalry.&nbsp; Faces of friends and relatives, long since
doomed to the battle-trench or the deep sea, have been recognised by
those who dared to gaze on the fairy march.&nbsp; The maid has seen
her lost lover, and the mother her stolen child; and the courage to
plan and achieve their deliverance has been possessed by, at least,
one border maiden.&nbsp; In the legends of the people of Corrievale,
there is a singular mixture of elfin and human adventure, and the traditional
story of the Cupbearer to the Queen of the Fairies appeals alike to
our domestic feelings and imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of the little green loops or bends on the banks of
Corriewater, mouldered walls, and a few <!-- page 11--><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>stunted
wild plum-trees and vagrant roses, still point out the site of a cottage
and garden.&nbsp; A well of pure spring-water leaps out from an old
tree-root before the door; and here the shepherds, shading themselves
in summer from the influence of the sun, tell to their children the
wild tale of Elphin Irving and his sister Phemie; and, singular as the
story seems, it has gained full credence among the people where the
scene is laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ken the tale and the place weel,&rdquo; interrupted an old
Scottish woman, who, from the predominance of scarlet in her apparel,
seemed to have been a follower of the camp,&mdash;&ldquo;I ken them
weel, and the tale&rsquo;s as true as a bullet to its aim and a spark
to powder.&nbsp; O bonnie Corriewater, a thousand times have I pulled
gowans on its banks wi&rsquo; ane that lies stiff and stark on a foreign
shore in a bloody grave;&rdquo; and, sobbing audibly, she drew the remains
of a military cloak over her face, and allowed the story to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Elphin Irving and his sister Phemie were in their sixteenth
year, for tradition says they were twins, their father was drowned in
Corriewater, attempting to save his sheep from a sudden swell, to which
all mountain streams are liable; and their mother, on the day of her
husband&rsquo;s burial, laid down her head on the pillow, from which,
on the seventh day, it was lifted to be dressed for the same grave.&nbsp;
The inheritance left to the orphans may be <!-- page 12--><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>briefly
described: seventeen acres of plough and pasture land, seven milk cows,
and seven pet sheep (many old people take delight in odd numbers); and
to this may be added seven bonnet-pieces of Scottish gold, and a broadsword
and spear, which their ancestor had wielded with such strength and courage
in the battle of Dryfe Sands, that the minstrel who sang of that deed
of arms ranked him only second to the Scotts and Johnstones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youth and his sister grew in stature and in beauty.&nbsp;
The brent bright brow, the clear blue eye, and frank and blithe deportment
of the former gave him some influence among the young women of the valley;
while the latter was no less the admiration of the young men, and at
fair and dance, and at bridal, happy was he who touched but her hand,
or received the benediction of her eye.&nbsp; Like all other Scottish
beauties, she was the theme of many a song; and while tradition is yet
busy with the singular history of her brother, song has taken all the
care that rustic minstrelsy can of the gentleness of her spirit and
the charms of her person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I vow,&rdquo; exclaimed a wandering piper, &ldquo;by mine
own honoured instrument, and by all other instruments that ever yielded
music for the joy and delight of mankind, that there are more bonnie
songs made about fair Phemie Irving than about all other dames of Annandale,
and many of them are both high and bonnie.&nbsp; A proud lass maun she
be if her spirit <!-- page 13--><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>hears;
and men say the dust lies not insensible of beautiful verse; for her
charms are breathed through a thousand sweet lips, and no further gone
than yestermorn I heard a lass singing on a green hillside what I shall
not readily forget.&nbsp; If ye like to listen, ye shall judge; and
it will not stay the story long, nor mar it much, for it is short, and
about Phemie Irving.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, accordingly, he chanted the following
rude verses, not unaccompanied by his honoured instrument, as he called
his pipe, which chimed in with great effect, and gave richness to a
voice which felt better than it could express:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>FAIR PHEMIE IRVING.</p>
<p>Gay is thy glen, Corrie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all thy groves flowering;<br />
Green is thy glen, Corrie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When July is showering;<br />
And sweet is yon wood where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The small birds are bowering,<br />
And there dwells the sweet one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom I am adoring.</p>
<p>Her round neck is whiter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than winter when snowing;<br />
Her meek voice is milder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than Ae in its flowing;<br />
The glad ground yields music<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where she goes by the river;<br />
One kind glance would charm me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever and ever.</p>
<p>The proud and the wealthy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Phemie are bowing;<br />
No looks of love win they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sighing or suing;<br />
<!-- page 14--><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Far away maun I stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With my rude wooing,<br />
She&rsquo;s a flow&rsquo;ret too lovely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too bloom for my pu&rsquo;ing.</p>
<p>Oh were I yon violet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On which she is walking;<br />
Oh were I yon small bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which she is talking;<br />
Or yon rose in her hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With its ripe ruddy blossom;<br />
Or some pure gentle thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be blest with her bosom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This minstrel interruption, while it established Phemie Irving&rsquo;s
claim to grace and to beauty, gave me additional confidence to pursue
the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But minstrel skill and true love-tale seemed to want their
usual influence when they sought to win her attention; she was only
observed to pay most respect to those youths who were most beloved by
her brother; and the same hour that brought these twins to the world
seemed to have breathed through them a sweetness and an affection of
heart and mind which nothing could divide.&nbsp; If, like the virgin
queen of the immortal poet, she walked &lsquo;in maiden meditation fancy
free,&rsquo; her brother Elphin seemed alike untouched with the charms
of the fairest virgins in Corrie.&nbsp; He ploughed his field, he reaped
his grain, he leaped, he ran, and wrestled, and danced, and sang, with
more skill and life and grace than all other youths of the district;
but he had no twilight and stolen interviews; when all <!-- page 15--><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>other
young men had their loves by their side, he was single, though not unsought,
and his joy seemed never perfect save when his sister was near him.&nbsp;
If he loved to share his time with her, she loved to share her time
with him alone, or with the beasts of the field, or the birds of the
air.&nbsp; She watched her little flock late, and she tended it early;
not for the sordid love of the fleece, unless it was to make mantles
for her brother, but with the look of one who had joy in its company.&nbsp;
The very wild creatures, the deer and the hares, seldom sought to shun
her approach, and the bird forsook not its nest, nor stinted its song,
when she drew nigh; such is the confidence which maiden innocence and
beauty inspire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened one summer, about three years after they became
orphans, that rain had been for a while withheld from the earth, the
hillsides began to parch, the grass in the vales to wither, and the
stream of Corrie was diminished between its banks to the size of an
ordinary rill.&nbsp; The shepherds drove their flocks to moorlands,
and marsh and tarn had their reeds invaded by the scythe to supply the
cattle with food.&nbsp; The sheep of his sister were Elphin&rsquo;s
constant care; he drove them to the moistest pastures during the day,
and he often watched them at midnight, when flocks, tempted by the sweet
dewy grass, are known to browse eagerly, that he might guard them from
the fox, and lead <!-- page 16--><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>them
to the choicest herbage.&nbsp; In these nocturnal watchings he sometimes
drove his little flock over the water of Corrie, for the fords were
hardly ankle-deep; or permitted his sheep to cool themselves in the
stream, and taste the grass which grew along the brink.&nbsp; All this
time not a drop of rain fell, nor did a cloud appear in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening, during her brother&rsquo;s absence with the flock,
Phemie sat at her cottage-door, listening to the bleatings of the distant
folds and the lessened murmur of the water of Corrie, now scarcely audible
beyond its banks.&nbsp; Her eyes, weary with watching along the accustomed
line of road for the return of Elphin, were turned on the pool beside
her, in which the stars were glimmering fitful and faint.&nbsp; As she
looked she imagined the water grew brighter and brighter; a wild illumination
presently shone upon the pool, and leaped from bank to bank, and suddenly
changing into a human form, ascended the margin, and, passing her, glided
swiftly into the cottage.&nbsp; The visionary form was so like her brother
in shape and air, that, starting up, she flew into the house, with the
hope of finding him in his customary seat.&nbsp; She found him not,
and, impressed with the terror which a wraith or apparition seldom fails
to inspire, she uttered a shriek so loud and so piercing as to be heard
at Johnstone Bank, on the other side of the vale of Corrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old woman now rose suddenly from her seat <!-- page 17--><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>in
the window-sill, the living dread of shepherds, for she travelled the
country with a brilliant reputation for witchcraft, and thus she broke
in upon the narrative: &ldquo;I vow, young man, ye tell us the truth
upset and down-thrust.&nbsp; I heard my douce grandmother say that on
the night when Elphin Irving disappeared&mdash;disappeared I shall call
it, for the bairn can but be gone for a season, to return to us in his
own appointed time&mdash;she was seated at the fireside at Johnstone
Bank; the laird had laid aside his bonnet to take the Book, when a shriek
mair loud, believe me, than a mere woman&rsquo;s shriek&mdash;and they
can shriek loud enough, else they&rsquo;re sair wranged&mdash;came over
the water of Corrie, so sharp and shrilling, that the pewter plates
dinneled on the wall; such a shriek, my douce grandmother said, as rang
in her ear till the hour of her death, and she lived till she was aughty-and-aught,
forty full ripe years after the event.&nbsp; But there is another matter,
which, doubtless, I cannot compel ye to believe: it was the common rumour
that Elphin Irving came not into the world like the other sinful creatures
of the earth, but was one of the kane-bairns of the fairies, whilk they
had to pay to the enemy of man&rsquo;s salvation every seventh year.&nbsp;
The poor lady-fairy&mdash;a mother&rsquo;s aye a mother, be she elves&rsquo;
flesh or Eve&rsquo;s flesh&mdash;hid her elf son beside the christened
flesh in Marion Irving&rsquo;s cradle, and the auld enemy lost his prey
for a time.&nbsp; Now, hasten on with your story, <!-- page 18--><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>which
is not a bodle the waur for me.&nbsp; The maiden saw the shape of her
brother, fell into a faint, or a trance, and the neighbours came flocking
in&mdash;gang on with your tale, young man, and dinna be affronted because
an auld woman helped ye wi &rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly known,&rdquo; I resumed, &ldquo;how long Phemie
Irving continued in a state of insensibility.&nbsp; The morning was
far advanced, when a neighbouring maiden found her seated in an old
chair, as white as monumental marble; her hair, about which she had
always been solicitous, loosened from its curls, and hanging disordered
over her neck and bosom, her hands and forehead.&nbsp; The maiden touched
the one, and kissed the other; they were as cold as snow; and her eyes,
wide open, were fixed on her brother&rsquo;s empty chair, with the intensity
of gaze of one who had witnessed the appearance of a spirit.&nbsp; She
seemed insensible of any one&rsquo;s presence, and sat fixed and still
and motionless.&nbsp; The maiden, alarmed at her looks, thus addressed
her:&mdash;&lsquo;Phemie, lass, Phemie Irving!&nbsp; Dear me, but this
be awful!&nbsp; I have come to tell ye that seven of your pet sheep
have escaped drowning in the water; for Corrie, sae quiet and sae gentle
yestreen, is rolling and dashing frae bank to bank this morning.&nbsp;
Dear me, woman, dinna let the loss of the world&rsquo;s gear bereave
ye of your senses.&nbsp; I would rather make ye a present of a dozen
mug-ewes of the Tinwald brood myself; and now I think <!-- page 19--><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>on
&rsquo;t, if ye&rsquo;ll send over Elphin, I will help him hame with
them in the gloaming myself.&nbsp; So, Phemie, woman, be comforted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the mention of her brother&rsquo;s name she cried out,
&lsquo;Where is he?&nbsp; Oh, where is he?&rsquo; gazed wildly round,
and, shuddering from head to foot, fell senseless on the floor.&nbsp;
Other inhabitants of the valley, alarmed by the sudden swell of the
river, which had augmented to a torrent, deep and impassable, now came
in to inquire if any loss had been sustained, for numbers of sheep and
teds of hay had been observed floating down about the dawn of the morning.&nbsp;
They assisted in reclaiming the unhappy maiden from her swoon; but insensibility
was joy compared to the sorrow to which she awakened.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
have ta&rsquo;en him away, they have ta&rsquo;en him away,&rsquo; she
chanted, in a tone of delirious pathos; &lsquo;him that was whiter and
fairer than the lily on Lyddal Lee.&nbsp; They have long sought, and
they have long sued, and they had the power to prevail against my prayers
at last.&nbsp; They have ta&rsquo;en him away; the flower is plucked
from among the weeds, and the dove is slain amid a flock of ravens.&nbsp;
They came with shout, and they came with song, and they spread the charm,
and they placed the spell, and the baptised brow has been bowed down
to the unbaptised hand.&nbsp; They have ta&rsquo;en him away, they have
ta&rsquo;en him away; he was too lovely, and too good, and too noble,
to bless us with his continuance <!-- page 20--><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>on
earth; for what are the sons of men compared to him?&mdash;the light
of the moonbeam to the morning sun, the glowworm to the eastern star.&nbsp;
They have ta&rsquo;en him away, the invisible dwellers of the earth.&nbsp;
I saw them come on him with shouting and with singing, and they charmed
him where he sat, and away they bore him; and the horse he rode was
never shod with iron, nor owned before the mastery of human hand.&nbsp;
They have ta&rsquo;en him away over the water, and over the wood, and
over the hill.&nbsp; I got but ae look of his bonnie blue ee, but ae;
ae look.&nbsp; But as I have endured what never maiden endured, so will
I undertake what never maiden undertook, I will win him from them all.&nbsp;
I know the invisible ones of the earth; I have heard their wild and
wondrous music in the wild woods, and there shall a christened maiden
seek him, and achieve his deliverance.&rsquo;&nbsp; She paused, and
glancing around a circle of condoling faces, down which the tears were
dropping like rain, said, in a calm and altered but still delirious
tone: &lsquo;Why do you weep, Mary Halliday? and why do you weep, John
Graeme?&nbsp; Ye think that Elphin Irving&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s a bonnie,
bonnie name, and dear to many a maiden&rsquo;s heart, as well as mine&mdash;ye
think he is drowned in Corrie; and ye will seek in the deep, deep pools
for the bonnie, bonnie corse, that ye may weep over it, as it lies in
its last linen, and lay it, amid weeping and wailing in the dowie kirkyard.&nbsp;
<!-- page 21--><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Ye may seek, but ye
shall never find; so leave me to trim up my hair, and prepare my dwelling,
and make myself ready to watch for the hour of his return to upper earth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And she resumed her household labours with an alacrity which lessened
not the sorrow of her friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the rumour flew over the vale that Elphin Irving
was drowned in Corriewater.&nbsp; Matron and maid, old man and young,
collected suddenly along the banks of the river, which now began to
subside to its natural summer limits, and commenced their search; interrupted
every now and then by calling from side to side, and from pool to pool,
and by exclamations of sorrow for this misfortune.&nbsp; The search
was fruitless: five sheep, pertaining to the flock which he conducted
to pasture, were found drowned in one of the deep eddies; but the river
was still too brown, from the soil of its moorland sources, to enable
them to see what its deep shelves, its pools, and its overhanging and
hazelly banks concealed.&nbsp; They remitted further search till the
stream should become pure; and old man taking old man aside, began to
whisper about the mystery of the youth&rsquo;s disappearance; old women
laid their lips to the ears of their coevals, and talked of Elphin Irving&rsquo;s
fairy parentage, and his having been dropped by an unearthly hand into
a Christian cradle.&nbsp; The young men and maids conversed on other
themes; they grieved for the loss of the <!-- page 22--><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>friend
and the lover, and while the former thought that a heart so kind and
true was not left in the vale, the latter thought, as maidens will,
on his handsome person, gentle manners, and merry blue eye, and speculated
with a sigh on the time when they might have hoped a return for their
love.&nbsp; They were soon joined by others who had heard the wild and
delirious language of his sister: the old belief was added to the new
assurance, and both again commented upon by minds full of superstitious
feeling, and hearts full of supernatural fears, till the youths and
maidens of Corrievale held no more love trysts for seven days and nights,
lest, like Elphin Irving, they should be carried away to augment the
ranks of the unchristened chivalry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was curious to listen to the speculations of the peasantry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For my part,&rsquo; said a youth, &lsquo;if I were sure that
poor Elphin escaped from that perilous water, I would not give the fairies
a pound of hiplock wool for their chance of him.&nbsp; There has not
been a fairy seen in the land since Donald Cargil, the Cameronian, conjured
them into the Solway for playing on their pipes during one of his nocturnal
preachings on the hip of the Burnswark hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Preserve me, bairn,&rsquo; said an old woman, justly
exasperated at the incredulity of her nephew, &lsquo;if ye winna believe
what I both heard and saw at the moonlight end of Craigyburnwood on
a summer <!-- page 23--><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>night, rank
after rank of the fairy folk, ye&rsquo;ll at least believe a douce man
and a ghostly professor, even the late minister of Tinwaldkirk.&nbsp;
His only son&mdash;I mind the lad weel, with his long yellow locks and
his bonnie blue eyes&mdash;when I was but a gilpie of a lassie, <i>he</i>
was stolen away from off the horse at his father&rsquo;s elbow, as they
crossed that false and fearsome water, even Locherbriggflow, on the
night of the Midsummer fair of Dumfries.&nbsp; Ay, ay, who can doubt
the truth of that?&nbsp; Have not the godly inhabitants of Almsfieldtown
and Tinwaldkirk seen the sweet youth riding at midnight, in the midst
of the unhallowed troop, to the sound of flute and of dulcimer, and
though meikle they prayed, naebody tried to achieve his deliverance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have heard it said by douce folk and sponsible,&rsquo;
interrupted another, &lsquo;that every seven years the elves and fairies
pay kane, or make an offering of one of their children, to the grand
enemy of salvation, and that they are permitted to purloin one of the
children of men to present to the fiend&mdash;a more acceptable offering,
I&rsquo;ll warrant, than one of their own infernal brood that are Satan&rsquo;s
sib allies, and drink a drop of the deil&rsquo;s blood every May morning.&nbsp;
And touching this lost lad, ye all ken his mother was a hawk of an uncanny
nest, a second cousin of Kate Kimmer, of Barfloshan, as rank a witch
as ever rode on ragwort.&nbsp; Ay, sirs, what&rsquo;s bred in the bone
is ill to come out of the flesh.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>&ldquo;On these
and similar topics, which a peasantry full of ancient tradition and
enthusiasm and superstition readily associate with the commonest occurrences
of life, the people of Corrievale continued to converse till the fall
of evening, when each, seeking their home, renewed again the wondrous
subject, and illustrated it with all that popular belief and poetic
imagination could so abundantly supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night which followed this melancholy day was wild with
wind and rain; the river came down broader and deeper than before, and
the lightning, flashing by fits over the green woods of Corrie, showed
the ungovernable and perilous flood sweeping above its banks.&nbsp;
It happened that a farmer, returning from one of the border fairs, encountered
the full swing of the storm; but mounted on an excellent horse, and
mantled from chin to heel in a good grey plaid, beneath which he had
the further security of a thick greatcoat, he sat dry in his saddle,
and proceeded in the anticipated joy of a subsided tempest and a glowing
morning sun.&nbsp; As he entered the long grove, or rather remains of
the old Galwegian forest, which lines for some space the banks of the
Corriewater, the storm began to abate, the wind sighed milder and milder
among the trees, and here and there a star, twinkling momentarily through
the sudden rack of the clouds, showed the river raging from bank to
brae.&nbsp; As he shook the moisture from his clothes, he was not without
a wish that the <!-- page 25--><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>day
would dawn, and that he might be preserved on a road which his imagination
beset with greater perils than the raging river; for his superstitious
feeling let loose upon his path elf and goblin, and the current traditions
of the district supplied very largely to his apprehension the ready
materials of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as he emerged from the wood, where a fine sloping bank,
covered with short greensward, skirts the limit of the forest, his horse
made a full pause, snorted, trembled, and started from side to side,
stooped his head, erected his ears, and seemed to scrutinise every tree
and bush.&nbsp; The rider, too, it may be imagined, gazed round and
round, and peered warily into every suspicious-looking place.&nbsp;
His dread of a supernatural visitation was not much allayed when he
observed a female shape seated on the ground at the root of a huge old
oak-tree, which stood in the centre of one of those patches of verdant
sward, known by the name of &lsquo;fairy rings,&rsquo; and avoided by
all peasants who wish to prosper.&nbsp; A long thin gleam of eastern
daylight enabled him to examine accurately the being who, in this wild
place and unusual hour, gave additional terror to this haunted spot.&nbsp;
She was dressed in white from the neck to the knees; her arms, long
and round and white, were perfectly bare; her head, uncovered, allowed
her long hair to descend in ringlet succeeding ringlet, till the half
of her person was nearly <!-- page 26--><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>concealed
in the fleece.&nbsp; Amidst the whole, her hands were constantly busy
in shedding aside the tresses which interposed between her steady and
uninterrupted gaze down a line of old road which wound among the hills
to an ancient burial-ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the traveller continued to gaze, the figure suddenly rose,
and, wringing the rain from her long locks, paced round and round the
tree, chanting in a wild and melancholy manner an equally wild and delirious
song.</p>
<blockquote><p>THE FAIRY OAK OF CORRIEWATER.</p>
<p>The small bird&rsquo;s head is under its wing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The deer sleeps on the grass;<br />
The moon comes out, and the stars shine down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dew gleams like the glass:<br />
There is no sound in the world so wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save the sound of the smitten brass,<br />
With the merry cittern and the pipe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the fairies as they pass.<br />
But oh! the fire maun burn and burn,<br />
And the hour is gone, and will never return.</p>
<p>The green hill cleaves, and forth, with a bound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes elf and elfin steed;<br />
The moon dives down in a golden cloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stars grow dim with dread;<br />
But a light is running along the earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So of heaven&rsquo;s they have no need:<br />
O&rsquo;er moor and moss with a shout they pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the word is spur and speed&mdash;<br />
But the fire maun burn, and I maun quake,<br />
And the hour is gone that will never come back.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>And when they came
to Craigyburnwood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Queen of the Fairies spoke:<br />
&ldquo;Come, bind your steeds to the rushes so green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dance by the haunted oak:<br />
I found the acorn on Heshbon Hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the nook of a palmer&rsquo;s poke,<br />
A thousand years since; here it grows!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they danced till the greenwood shook:<br />
But oh! the fire, the burning fire,<br />
The longer it burns, it but blazes the higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have won me a youth,&rdquo; the Elf Queen said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The fairest that earth may see;<br />
This night I have won young Elph Irving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My cupbearer to be.<br />
His service lasts but seven sweet years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his wage is a kiss of me.&rdquo;<br />
And merrily, merrily, laughed the wild elves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round Corris&rsquo;s greenwood tree.<br />
But oh! the fire it glows in my brain,<br />
And the hour is gone, and comes not again.</p>
<p>The Queen she has whispered a secret word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come hither my Elphin sweet,<br />
And bring that cup of the charm&eacute;d wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy lips and mine to weet.&rdquo;<br />
But a brown elf shouted a loud, loud shout,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, leap on your coursers fleet,<br />
For here comes the smell of some baptised flesh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sounding of baptised feet.&rdquo;<br />
But oh! the fire that burns, and maun burn;<br />
For the time that is gone will never return.</p>
<p>On a steed as white as the new-milked milk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elf Queen leaped with a bound,<br />
And young Elphin a steed like December snow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath him at the word he found.<br />
But a maiden came, and her christened arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She linked her brother around,<br />
<!-- page 28--><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>And called on God,
and the steed with a snort<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sank into the gaping ground.<br />
But the fire maun burn, and I maun quake,<br />
And the time that is gone will no more come back.</p>
<p>And she held her brother, and lo! he grew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wild bull waked in ire;<br />
And she held her brother, and lo! he changed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To a river roaring higher;<br />
And she held her brother, and he became<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A flood of the raging fire;<br />
She shrieked and sank, and the wild elves laughed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the mountain rang and mire.<br />
But oh! the fire yet burns in my brain,<br />
And the hour is gone, and comes not again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O maiden, why waxed thy faith so faint,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy spirit so slack and slaw?<br />
Thy courage kept good till the flame waxed wud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then thy might begun to thaw;<br />
Had ye kissed him with thy christened lip,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye had wan him frae &rsquo;mang us a&rsquo;.<br />
Now bless the fire, the elfin fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That made thee faint and fa&rsquo;;<br />
Now bless the fire, the elfin fire,<br />
The longer it burns it blazes the higher.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At the close of this unusual strain, the figure sat down on
the grass, and proceeded to bind up her long and disordered tresses,
gazing along the old and unfrequented road.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now God be
my helper,&rsquo; said the traveller, who happened to be the laird of
Johnstone Bank, &lsquo;can this be a trick of the fiend, or can it be
bonnie Phemie Irving who chants this dolorous sang?&nbsp; Something
sad has befallen that makes her seek her seat in this eerie nook amid
the darkness and tempest; through might from <!-- page 29--><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>aboon
I will go on and see.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the horse, feeling something
of the owner&rsquo;s reviving spirit in the application of spur-steel,
bore him at once to the foot of the tree.&nbsp; The poor delirious maiden
uttered a yell of piercing joy as she beheld him, and, with the swiftness
of a creature winged, linked her arms round the rider&rsquo;s waist,
and shrieked till the woods rang.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I have ye now, Elphin,
I have ye now,&rsquo; and she strained him to her bosom with a convulsive
grasp.&nbsp; &lsquo;What ails ye, my bonnie lass?&rsquo; said the laird
of Johnstone Bank, his fears of the supernatural vanishing when he beheld
her sad and bewildered look.&nbsp; She raised her eyes at the sound,
and seeing a strange face, her arms slipped their hold, and she dropped
with a groan on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning had now fairly broke; the flocks shook the rain
from their sides, the shepherds hastened to inspect their charges, and
a thin blue smoke began to stream from the cottages of the valley into
the brightening air.&nbsp; The laird carried Phemie Irving in his arms,
till he observed two shepherds ascending from one of the loops of Corriewater,
bearing the lifeless body of her brother.&nbsp; They had found him whirling
round and round in one of the numerous eddies, and his hands, clutched
and filled with wool, showed that he had lost his life in attempting
to save the flock of his sister.&nbsp; A plaid was laid over the body,
which, along with the unhappy maiden in a half-lifeless state, was carried
<!-- page 30--><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>into a cottage, and
laid in that apartment distinguished among the peasantry by the name
of the chamber.&nbsp; While the peasant&rsquo;s wife was left to take
care of Phemie, old man and matron and maid had collected around the
drowned youth, and each began to relate the circumstances of his death,
when the door suddenly opened, and his sister, advancing to the corpse,
with a look of delirious serenity, broke out into a wild laugh and said:
&lsquo;Oh, it is wonderful, it&rsquo;s truly wonderful!&nbsp; That bare
and death-cold body, dragged from the darkest pool of Corrie, with its
hands filled with fine wool, wears the perfect similitude of my own
Elphin!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell ye&mdash;the spiritual dwellers of the
earth, the fairyfolk of our evening tale, have stolen the living body,
and fashioned this cold and inanimate clod to mislead your pursuit.&nbsp;
In common eyes this seems all that Elphin Irving would be, had he sunk
in Corriewater; but so it seems not to me.&nbsp; Ye have sought the
living soul, and ye have found only its garment.&nbsp; But oh, if ye
had beheld him, as I beheld him to-night, riding among the elfin troop,
the fairest of them all; had you clasped him in your arms, and wrestled
for him with spirits and terrible shapes from the other world, till
your heart quailed and your flesh was subdued, then would ye yield no
credit to the semblance which this cold and apparent flesh bears to
my brother.&nbsp; But hearken!&nbsp; On Hallowmass Eve, when the spiritual
people are let loose on earth for <!-- page 31--><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>a
season, I will take my stand in the burial-ground of Corrie; and when
my Elphin and his unchristened troop come past, with the sound of all
their minstrelsy, I will leap on him and win him, or perish for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All gazed aghast on the delirious maiden, and many of her
auditors gave more credence to her distempered speech than to the visible
evidence before them.&nbsp; As she turned to depart, she looked round,
and suddenly sank upon the body, with tears streaming from her eyes,
and sobbed out, &lsquo;My brother!&nbsp; Oh, my brother!&rsquo;&nbsp;
She was carried out insensible, and again recovered; but relapsed into
her ordinary delirium, in which she continued till the Hallow Eve after
her brother&rsquo;s burial.&nbsp; She was found seated in the ancient
burial-ground, her back against a broken gravestone, her locks white
with frost-rime, watching with intensity of look the road to the kirkyard;
but the spirit which gave life to the fairest form of all the maids
of Annandale was fled for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the singular story which the peasants know by the name of
&ldquo;Elphin Irving, the Fairies&rsquo; Cupbearer&rdquo;; and the title,
in its fullest and most supernatural sense, still obtains credence among
the industrious and virtuous dames of the romantic vale of Corrie.</p>
<h2><!-- page 32--><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>THE GHOSTS OF CRAIG-AULNAIC.</h2>
<p>Two celebrated ghosts existed, once on a time, in the wilds of Craig-Aulnaic,
a romantic place in the district of Strathdown, Banffshire.&nbsp; The
one was a male and the other a female.&nbsp; The male was called Fhuna
Mhoir Ben Baynac, after one of the mountains of Glenavon, where at one
time he resided; and the female was called Clashnichd Aulnaic, from
her having had her abode in Craig-Aulnaic.&nbsp; But although the great
ghost of Ben Baynac was bound by the common ties of nature and of honour
to protect and cherish his weaker companion, Clashnichd Aulnaic, yet
he often treated her in the most cruel and unfeeling manner.&nbsp; In
the dead of night, when the surrounding hamlets were buried in deep
repose, and when nothing else disturbed the solemn stillness of the
midnight scene, oft would the shrill shrieks of poor Clashnichd burst
upon the slumberer&rsquo;s ears, and awake him to anything but pleasant
reflections.</p>
<p>But of all those who were incommoded by the noisy and unseemly quarrels
of these two ghosts, James Owre or Gray, the tenant of the farm of <!-- page 33--><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Balbig
of Delnabo, was the greatest sufferer.&nbsp; From the proximity of his
abode to their haunts, it was the misfortune of himself and family to
be the nightly audience of Clashnichd&rsquo;s cries and lamentations,
which they considered anything but agreeable entertainment.</p>
<p>One day as James Gray was on his rounds looking after his sheep,
he happened to fall in with Clashnichd, the ghost of Aulnaic, with whom
he entered into a long conversation.&nbsp; In the course of it he took
occasion to remonstrate with her on the very disagreeable disturbance
she caused himself and family by her wild and unearthly cries&mdash;cries
which, he said, few mortals could relish in the dreary hours of midnight.&nbsp;
Poor Clashnichd, by way of apology for her conduct, gave James Gray
a sad account of her usage, detailing at full length the series of cruelties
committed upon her by Ben Baynac.&nbsp; From this account, it appeared
that her living with the latter was by no means a matter of choice with
Clashnichd; on the contrary, it seemed that she had, for a long time,
lived apart with much comfort, residing in a snug dwelling, as already
mentioned, in the wilds of Craig-Aulnaic; but Ben Baynac having unfortunately
taken into his head to pay her a visit, took a fancy, not to herself,
but her dwelling, of which, in his own name and authority, he took immediate
possession, and soon after he expelled poor Clashnichd, with many stripes,
from her natural <!-- page 34--><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>inheritance.&nbsp;
Not satisfied with invading and depriving her of her just rights, he
was in the habit of following her into her private haunts, not with
the view of offering her any endearments, but for the purpose of inflicting
on her person every torment which his brain could invent.</p>
<p>Such a moving relation could not fail to affect the generous heart
of James Gray, who determined from that moment to risk life and limb
in order to vindicate the rights and avenge the wrongs of poor Clashnichd,
the ghost of Craig-Aulnaic.&nbsp; He, therefore, took good care to interrogate
his new <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> touching the nature of her oppressor&rsquo;s
constitution, whether he was of that <i>killable</i> species of ghost
that could be shot with a silver sixpence, or if there was any other
weapon that could possibly accomplish his annihilation.&nbsp; Clashnichd
informed him that she had occasion to know that Ben Baynac was wholly
invulnerable to all the weapons of man, with the exception of a large
mole on his left breast, which was no doubt penetrable by silver or
steel; but that, from the specimens she had of his personal prowess
and strength, it were vain for mere man to attempt to combat him.&nbsp;
Confiding, however, in his expertness as an archer&mdash;for he was
allowed to be the best marksman of the age&mdash;James Gray told Clashnichd
he did not fear him with all his might,&mdash;that <i>he</i> was a man;
and desired her, moreover, next time the ghost chose <!-- page 35--><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to
repeat his incivilities to her, to apply to him, James Gray, for redress.</p>
<p>It was not long ere he had an opportunity of fulfilling his promises.&nbsp;
Ben Baynac having one night, in the want of better amusement, entertained
himself by inflicting an inhuman castigation on Clashnichd, she lost
no time in waiting on James Gray, with a full and particular account
of it.&nbsp; She found him smoking his <i>cutty</i>, for it was night
when she came to him; but, notwithstanding the inconvenience of the
hour, James needed no great persuasion to induce him to proceed directly
along with Clashnichd to hold a communing with their friend, Ben Baynac,
the great ghost.&nbsp; Clashnichd was stout and sturdy, and understood
the knack of travelling much better than our women do.&nbsp; She expressed
a wish that, for the sake of expedition, James Gray would suffer her
to bear him along, a motion to which the latter agreed; and a few minutes
brought them close to the scene of Ben Baynac&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp;
As they approached his haunt, he came forth to meet them, with looks
and gestures which did not at all indicate a cordial welcome.&nbsp;
It was a fine moonlight night, and they could easily observe his actions.&nbsp;
Poor Clashnichd was now sorely afraid of the great ghost.&nbsp; Apprehending
instant destruction from his fury, she exclaimed to James Gray that
they would be both dead people, and that immediately, unless James Gray
hit with an arrow the mole which covered Ben <!-- page 36--><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Baynac&rsquo;s
heart.&nbsp; This was not so difficult a task as James had hitherto
apprehended it.&nbsp; The mole was as large as a common bonnet, and
yet nowise disproportioned to the natural size of the ghost&rsquo;s
body, for he certainly was a great and a mighty ghost.&nbsp; Ben Baynac
cried out to James Gray that he would soon make eagle&rsquo;s meat of
him; and certain it is, such was his intention, had not the shepherd
so effectually stopped him from the execution of it.&nbsp; Raising his
bow to his eye when within a few yards of Ben Baynac, he took deliberate
aim; the arrow flew&mdash;it hit&mdash;a yell from Ben Baynac announced
the result.&nbsp; A hideous howl re-echoed from the surrounding mountains,
responsive to the groans of a thousand ghosts; and Ben Baynac, like
the smoke of a shot, vanished into air.</p>
<p>Clashnichd, the ghost of Aulnaic, now found herself emancipated from
the most abject state of slavery, and restored to freedom and liberty,
through the invincible courage of James Gray.&nbsp; Overpowered with
gratitude, she fell at his feet, and vowed to devote the whole of her
time and talents towards his service and prosperity.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
being anxious to have her remaining goods and furniture removed to her
former dwelling, whence she had been so iniquitously expelled by Ben
Baynac, the great ghost, she requested of her new master the use of
his horses to remove them.&nbsp; James observing on the adjacent hill
a flock of deer, and wishing to have a <!-- page 37--><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>trial
of his new servant&rsquo;s sagacity or expertness, told her those were
his horses&mdash;she was welcome to the use of them; desiring that when
she had done with them, she would inclose them in his stable.&nbsp;
Clashnichd then proceeded to make use of the horses, and James Gray
returned home to enjoy his night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>Scarce had he reached his arm-chair, and reclined his cheek on his
hand, to ruminate over the bold adventure of the night, when Clashnichd
entered, with her &ldquo;breath in her throat,&rdquo; and venting the
bitterest complaints at the unruliness of his horses, which had broken
one-half of her furniture, and caused her more trouble in the stabling
of them than their services were worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they are stabled, then?&rdquo; inquired James Gray.&nbsp;
Clashnichd replied in the affirmative.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
rejoined James, &ldquo;they shall be tame enough to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this specimen of Clashnichd, the ghost of Craig-Aulnaic&rsquo;s
expertness, it will be seen what a valuable acquisition her service
proved to James Gray and his young family.&nbsp; They were, however,
speedily deprived of her assistance by a most unfortunate accident.&nbsp;
From the sequel of the story, from which the foregoing is an extract,
it appears that poor Clashnichd was deeply addicted to propensities
which at that time rendered her kin so obnoxious to their human neighbours.&nbsp;
She was constantly in the habit of visiting her friends much <!-- page 38--><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>oftener
than she was invited, and, in the course of such visits, was never very
scrupulous in making free with any eatables which fell within the circle
of her observation.</p>
<p>One day, while engaged on a foraging expedition of this description,
she happened to enter the Mill of Delnabo, which was inhabited in those
days by the miller&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; She found his wife engaged
in roasting a large gridiron of fine savoury fish, the agreeable smell
proceeding from which perhaps occasioned her visit.&nbsp; With the usual
inquiries after the health of the miller and his family, Clashnichd
proceeded with the greatest familiarity and good-humour to make herself
comfortable at their expense.&nbsp; But the miller&rsquo;s wife, enraged
at the loss of her fish, and not relishing such unwelcome familiarity,
punished the unfortunate Clashnichd rather too severely for her freedom.&nbsp;
It happened that there was at the time a large caldron of boiling water
suspended over the fire, and this caldron the enraged wife overturned
in Clashnichd&rsquo;s bosom!</p>
<p>Scalded beyond recovery, she fled up the wilds of Craig-Aulnaic,
uttering the most melancholy lamentations, nor has she been ever heard
of since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Conan is as bonny a river as we hae in a&rsquo; the north
country.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s mony a sweet sunny spot on its banks, an&rsquo;
mony a time an&rsquo; aft hae I waded through its shallows, whan a boy,
to set my little scautling-line for the trouts an&rsquo; the eels, or
to gather the big pearl-mussels that lie sae thick in the fords.&nbsp;
But its bonny wooded banks are places for enjoying the day in&mdash;no
for passing the nicht.&nbsp; I kenna how it is; it&rsquo;s nane o&rsquo;
your wild streams that wander desolate through a desert country, like
the Aven, or that come rushing down in foam and thunder, ower broken
rocks, like the Foyers, or that wallow in darkness, deep, deep in the

yet no ane o&rsquo; these rivers has mair or frightfuller stories connected
wi&rsquo; it than the Conan.&nbsp; Ane can hardly saunter ower half-a-mile
in its course, frae where it leaves Coutin till where it enters the
sea, without passing ower the scene o&rsquo; some frightful auld legend
o&rsquo; the kelpie or the waterwraith.&nbsp; And ane o&rsquo; the most
frightful looking o&rsquo; these places is to be found among the <!-- page 40--><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>woods
of Conan House.&nbsp; Ye enter a swampy meadow that waves wi&rsquo;
flags an&rsquo; rushes like a corn-field in harvest, an&rsquo; see a
hillock covered wi&rsquo; willows rising like an island in the midst.&nbsp;
There are thick mirk-woods on ilka side; the river, dark an&rsquo; awesome,
an&rsquo; whirling round an&rsquo; round in mossy eddies, sweeps away
behind it; an&rsquo; there is an auld burying-ground, wi&rsquo; the
broken ruins o&rsquo; an auld Papist kirk, on the tap.&nbsp; Ane can
see amang the rougher stanes the rose-wrought mullions of an arched
window, an&rsquo; the trough that ance held the holy water.&nbsp; About
twa hunder years ago&mdash;a wee mair maybe, or a wee less, for ane
canna be very sure o&rsquo; the date o&rsquo; thae old stories&mdash;the
building was entire; an&rsquo; a spot near it, whar the wood now grows
thickest, was laid out in a corn-field.&nbsp; The marks o&rsquo; the
furrows may still be seen amang the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A party o&rsquo; Highlanders were busily engaged, ae day in
harvest, in cutting down the corn o&rsquo; that field; an&rsquo; just
aboot noon, when the sun shone brightest an&rsquo; they were busiest
in the work, they heard a voice frae the river exclaim:&mdash;&lsquo;The
hour but not the man has come.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sure enough, on looking
round, there was the kelpie stan&rsquo;in&rsquo; in what they ca&rsquo;
a fause ford, just fornent the auld kirk.&nbsp; There is a deep black
pool baith aboon an&rsquo; below, but i&rsquo; the ford there&rsquo;s
a bonny ripple, that shows, as ane might think, but little depth o&rsquo;
water; an&rsquo; just i&rsquo; <!-- page 41--><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>the
middle o&rsquo; that, in a place where a horse might swim, stood the
kelpie.&nbsp; An&rsquo; it again repeated its words:&mdash;&lsquo;The
hour but not the man has come,&rsquo; an&rsquo; then flashing through
the water like a drake, it disappeared in the lower pool.&nbsp; When
the folk stood wondering what the creature might mean, they saw a man
on horseback come spurring down the hill in hot haste, making straight
for the fause ford.&nbsp; They could then understand her words at ance;
an&rsquo; four o&rsquo; the stoutest o&rsquo; them sprang oot frae amang
the corn to warn him o&rsquo; his danger, an&rsquo; keep him back.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; sae they tauld him what they had seen an&rsquo; heard, an&rsquo;
urged him either to turn back an&rsquo; tak&rsquo; anither road, or
stay for an hour or sae where he was.&nbsp; But he just wadna hear them,
for he was baith unbelieving an&rsquo; in haste, an&rsquo; wauld hae
taen the ford for a&rsquo; they could say, hadna the Highlanders, determined
on saving him whether he would or no, gathered round him an&rsquo; pulled
him frae his horse, an&rsquo; then, to mak&rsquo; sure o&rsquo; him,
locked him up in the auld kirk.&nbsp; Weel, when the hour had gone by&mdash;the
fatal hour o&rsquo; the kelpie&mdash;they flung open the door, an&rsquo;
cried to him that he might noo gang on his journey.&nbsp; Ah! but there
was nae answer, though; an&rsquo; sae they cried a second time, an&rsquo;
there was nae answer still; an&rsquo; then they went in, an&rsquo; found
him lying stiff an&rsquo; cauld on the floor, wi&rsquo; his face buried
in the water o&rsquo; the very stone trough that we may still see amang
the ruins.&nbsp; <!-- page 42--><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>His
hour had come, an&rsquo; he had fallen in a fit, as &rsquo;twould seem,
head-foremost amang the water o&rsquo; the trough, where he had been
smothered,&mdash;an&rsquo; sae ye see, the prophecy o&rsquo; the kelpie
availed naething.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 43--><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>WHIPPETY STOURIE.</h2>
<p>There was once a gentleman that lived in a very grand house, and
he married a young lady that had been delicately brought up.&nbsp; In
her husband&rsquo;s house she found everything that was fine&mdash;fine
tables and chairs, fine looking-glasses, and fine curtains; but then
her husband expected her to be able to spin twelve hanks o&rsquo; thread
every day, besides attending to her house; and, to tell the even-down
truth, the lady could not spin a bit.&nbsp; This made her husband glunchy
with her, and, before a month had passed, she found hersel&rsquo; very
unhappy.</p>
<p>One day the husband gaed away upon a journey, after telling her that
he expected her, before his return, to have not only learned to spin,
but to have spun a hundred hanks o&rsquo; thread.&nbsp; Quite downcast,
she took a walk along the hillside, till she cam&rsquo; to a big flat
stane, and there she sat down and grat.&nbsp; By and by she heard a
strain o&rsquo; fine sma&rsquo; music, coming as it were frae aneath
the stane, and, on turning it up, she saw a cave below, where there
were sitting <!-- page 44--><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>six wee
ladies in green gowns, ilk ane o&rsquo; them spinning on a little wheel,
and singing,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Little kens my dame at hame<br />
That Whippety Stourie is my name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lady walked into the cave, and was kindly asked by the wee bodies
to take a chair and sit down, while they still continued their spinning.&nbsp;
She observed that ilk ane&rsquo;s mouth was thrawn away to ae side,
but she didna venture to speer the reason.&nbsp; They asked why she
looked so unhappy, and she telt them that it was she was expected by
her husband to be a good spinner, when the plain truth was that she
could not spin at all, and found herself quite unable for it, having
been so delicately brought up; neither was there any need for it, as
her husband was a rich man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that a&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the little wifies, speaking
out of their cheeks alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and is it not a very good a&rsquo; too?&rdquo; said the
lady, her heart like to burst wi&rsquo; distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could easily quit ye o&rsquo; that trouble,&rdquo; said
the wee women.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just ask us a&rsquo; to dinner for the day
when your husband is to come back.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll then let you see
how we&rsquo;ll manage him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the lady asked them all to dine with herself and her husband,
on the day when he was to come back.</p>
<p>When the gudeman came hame, he found the <!-- page 45--><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>house
so occupied with preparations for dinner, that he had nae time to ask
his wife about her thread; and, before ever he had ance spoken to her
on the subject, the company was announced at the hall door.&nbsp; The
six ladies all came in a coach-and-six, and were as fine as princesses,
but still wore their gowns of green.&nbsp; The gentleman was very polite,
and showed them up the stair with a pair of wax candles in his hand.&nbsp;
And so they all sat down to dinner, and conversation went on very pleasantly,
till at length the husband, becoming familiar with them, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies, if it be not an uncivil question, I should like to
know how it happens that all your mouths are turned away to one side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said ilk ane at ance, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s with our
constant <i>spin-spin-spinning</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the case?&rdquo; cried the gentleman; &ldquo;then,
John, Tam, and Dick, fie, go haste and burn every rock, and reel, and
spinning-wheel in the house, for I&rsquo;ll not have my wife to spoil
her bonnie face with <i>spin-spin-spinning</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the lady lived happily with her gudeman all the rest of her
days.</p>
<h2><!-- page 46--><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>THE WEIRD OF THE
THREE ARROWS.</h2>
<p>Sir James Douglas, the companion of Bruce, and well known by his
appellation of the &ldquo;Black Douglas,&rdquo; was once, during the
hottest period of the exterminating war carried on by him and his colleague
Randolph, against the English, stationed at Linthaughlee, near Jedburgh.&nbsp;
He was resting, himself and his men after the toils of many days&rsquo;
fighting-marches through Teviotdale; and, according to his custom, had
walked round the tents, previous to retiring to the unquiet rest of
a soldier&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; He stood for a few minutes at the entrance
to his tent contemplating the scene before him, rendered more interesting
by a clear moon, whose silver beams fell, in the silence of a night
without a breath of wind, calmly on the slumbers of mortals destined
to mix in the mel&eacute;e of dreadful war, perhaps on the morrow.&nbsp;
As he stood gazing, irresolute whether to retire to rest or indulge
longer in a train of thought not very suitable to a warrior who delighted
in the spirit-stirring scenes of his profession, his eye was attracted
by the figure of an old woman, who approached <!-- page 47--><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>him
with a trembling step, leaning on a staff, and holding in her left hand
three English cloth-shaft arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are he who is ca&rsquo;ed the guid Sir James?&rdquo; said
the old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, good woman,&rdquo; replied Sir James.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
hast thou wandered from the sutler&rsquo;s camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dinna belang to the camp o&rsquo; the hoblers,&rdquo; answered
the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hae been a residenter in Linthaughlee since
the day when King Alexander passed the door o&rsquo; my cottage wi&rsquo;
his bonny French bride, wha was terrified awa&rsquo; frae Jedburgh by
the death&rsquo;s-head whilk appeared to her on the day o&rsquo; her
marriage.&nbsp; What I hae suffered sin&rsquo; that day&rdquo; (looking
at the arrows in her hand) &ldquo;lies between me an&rsquo; heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of your sons have been killed in the wars, I presume?&rdquo;
said Sir James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye hae guessed a pairt o&rsquo; my waes,&rdquo; replied the
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;That arrow&rdquo; (holding out one of the three)
&ldquo;carries on its point the bluid o&rsquo; my first born; that is
stained wi&rsquo; the stream that poured frae the heart o&rsquo; my
second; and that is red wi&rsquo; the gore in which my youngest weltered,
as he gae up the life that made me childless.&nbsp; They were a&rsquo;
shot by English hands, in different armies, in different battles.&nbsp;
I am an honest woman, and wish to return to the English what belongs
to the English; but that in the same fashion in which they were sent.&nbsp;
<!-- page 48--><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>The Black Douglas has
the strongest arm an&rsquo; the surest ee in auld Scotland; an&rsquo;
wha can execute my commission better than he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not use the bow, good woman,&rdquo; replied Sir James.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I love the grasp of the dagger or the battle-axe.&nbsp; You must
apply to some other individual to return your arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I canna tak&rsquo; them hame again,&rdquo; said the woman,
laying them down at the feet of Sir James.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll
see me again on St. James&rsquo; E&rsquo;en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman departed as she said these words.</p>
<p>Sir James took up the arrows, and placed them in an empty quiver
that lay amongst his baggage.&nbsp; He retired to rest, but not to sleep.&nbsp;
The figure of the old woman and her strange request occupied his thoughts,
and produced trains of meditation which ended in nothing but restlessness
and disquietude.&nbsp; Getting up at daybreak, he met a messenger at
the entrance of his tent, who informed him that Sir Thomas de Richmont,
with a force of ten thousand men, had crossed the Borders, and would
pass through a narrow defile, which he mentioned, where he could be
attacked with great advantage.&nbsp; Sir James gave instant orders to
march to the spot; and, with that genius for scheming, for which he
was so remarkable, commanded his men to twist together the young birch-trees
on either side of the passage to prevent the escape of the enemy.&nbsp;
This finished, he concealed his archers in a hollow way, near the gorge
of the pass.</p>
<p><!-- page 49--><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>The enemy came on;
and when their ranks were embarrassed by the narrowness of the road,
and it was impossible for the cavalry to act with effect, Sir James
rushed upon them at the head of his horsemen; and the archers, suddenly
discovering themselves, poured in a flight of arrows on the confused
soldiers, and put the whole army to flight.&nbsp; In the heat of the
onset, Douglas killed Sir Thomas de Richmont with his dagger.</p>
<p>Not long after this, Edmund de Cailon, a knight of Gascony, and Governor
of Berwick, who had been heard to vaunt that he had sought the famous
Black Knight, but could not find him, was returning to England, loaded
with plunder, the fruit of an inroad on Teviotdale.&nbsp; Sir James
thought it a pity that a Gascon&rsquo;s vaunt should be heard unpunished
in Scotland, and made long forced marches to satisfy the desire of the
foreign knight, by giving him a sight of the dark countenance he had
made a subject of reproach.&nbsp; He soon succeeded in gratifying both
himself and the Gascon.&nbsp; Coming up in his terrible manner, he called
to Cailon to stop, and, before he proceeded into England, receive the
respects of the Black Knight he had come to find, but hitherto had not
met.&nbsp; The Gascon&rsquo;s vaunt was now changed; but shame supplied
the place of courage, and he ordered his men to receive Douglas&rsquo;s
attack.&nbsp; Sir James assiduously sought his enemy.&nbsp; He at last
succeeded; and a single combat ensued, <!-- page 50--><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>of
a most desperate character.&nbsp; But who ever escaped the arm of Douglas
when fairly opposed to him in single conflict?&nbsp; Cailon was killed;
he had met the Black Knight at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much,&rdquo; cried Sir James, &ldquo;for the vaunt of a
Gascon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similar in every respect to the fate of Cailon, was that of Sir Ralph
Neville.&nbsp; He, too, on hearing the great fame of Douglas&rsquo;s
prowess, from some of Gallon&rsquo;s fugitive soldiers, openly boasted
that he would fight with the Scottish Knight, if he would come and show
his banner before Berwick.&nbsp; Sir James heard the boast and rejoiced
in it.&nbsp; He marched to that town, and caused his men to ravage the
country in front of the battlements, and burn the villages.&nbsp; Neville
left Berwick with a strong body of men; and, stationing himself on a
high ground, waited till the rest of the Scots should disperse to plunder;
but Douglas called in his detachment and attacked the knight.&nbsp;
After a desperate conflict, in which many were slain, Douglas, as was
his custom, succeeded in bringing the leader to a personal encounter,
and the skill of the Scottish knight was again successful.&nbsp; Neville
was slain, and his men utterly discomfited.</p>
<p>Having retired one night to his tent to take some rest after so much
pain and toil, Sir James Douglas was surprised by the reappearance of
the old woman whom he had seen at Linthaughlee.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>&ldquo;This is the
feast o&rsquo; St. James,&rdquo; said she, as she approached him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I said I would see ye again this nicht, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m as
guid&rsquo;s my word.&nbsp; Hae ye returned the arrows I left wi&rsquo;
ye to the English wha sent them to the hearts o&rsquo; my sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Sir James.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told ye I did
not fight with the bow.&nbsp; Wherefore do ye importune me thus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me back the arrows then,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>
<p>Sir James went to bring the quiver in which he had placed them.&nbsp;
On taking them out, he was surprised to find that they were all broken
through the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How has this happened?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I put
these arrows in this quiver entire, and now they are broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weird is fulfilled!&rdquo; cried the old woman, laughing
eldrichly, and clapping her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;That broken shaft cam&rsquo;
frae a soldier o&rsquo; Richmont&rsquo;s; that frae ane o&rsquo; Cailon&rsquo;s,
and that frae ane o&rsquo; Neville&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They are a&rsquo;
dead, an&rsquo; I am revenged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman then departed, scattering, as she went, the broken
fragments of the arrows on the floor of the tent.</p>
<h2><!-- page 52--><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>THE LAIRD OF BALMACHIE&rsquo;S
WIFE.</h2>
<p>In the olden times, when it was the fashion for gentlemen to wear
swords, the Laird of Balmachie went one day to Dundee, leaving his wife
at home ill in bed.&nbsp; Riding home in the twilight, he had occasion
to leave the high road, and when crossing between some little romantic
knolls, called the Cur-hills, in the neighbourhood of Carlungy, he encountered
a troop of fairies supporting a kind of litter, upon which some person
seemed to be borne.&nbsp; Being a man of dauntless courage, and, as
he said, impelled by some internal impulse, he pushed his horse close
to the litter, drew his sword, laid it across the vehicle, and in a
firm tone exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of God, release your captive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiny troop immediately disappeared, dropping the litter on the
ground.&nbsp; The laird dismounted, and found that it contained his
own wife, dressed in her bedclothes.&nbsp; Wrapping his coat around
her, he placed her on the horse before him, and, having <!-- page 53--><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>only
a short distance to ride, arrived safely at home.</p>
<p>Placing her in another room, under the care of an attentive friend,
he immediately went to the chamber where he had left his wife in the
morning, and there to all appearance she still lay, very sick of a fever.&nbsp;
She was fretful, discontented, and complained much of having been neglected
in his absence, at all of which the laird affected great concern, and
pretending much sympathy, insisted upon her rising to have her bed made.&nbsp;
She said that she was unable to rise, but her husband was peremptory,
and having ordered a large wood fire to warm the room, he lifted the
impostor from the bed, and bearing her across the floor as if to a chair,
which had been previously prepared, he threw her on the fire, from which
she bounced like a sky-rocket, and went through the ceiling, and out
at the roof of the house, leaving a hole among the slates.&nbsp; He
then brought in his own wife, a little recovered from her alarm, who
said, that sometime after sunset, the nurse having left her for the
purpose of preparing a little candle, a multitude of elves came in at
the window, thronging like bees from a hive.&nbsp; They filled the room,
and having lifted her from the bed carried her through the window, after
which she recollected nothing further, till she saw her husband standing
over her on the Cur-hills, at the back of <!-- page 54--><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Carlungy.&nbsp;
The hole in the roof, by which the female fairy made her escape, was
mended, but could never be kept in repair, as a tempest of wind happened
always once a year, which uncovered that particular spot, without injuring
any other part of the roof.</p>
<h2><!-- page 55--><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>MICHAEL SCOTT.</h2>
<p>In the early part of Michael Scott&rsquo;s life he was in the habit
of emigrating annually to the Scottish metropolis, for the purpose of
being employed in his capacity of mason.&nbsp; One time as he and two
companions were journeying to the place of their destination for a similar
object, they had occasion to pass over a high hill, the name of which
is not mentioned, but which is supposed to have been one of the Grampians,
and being fatigued with climbing, they sat down to rest themselves.&nbsp;
They had no sooner done so than they were warned to take to their heels
by the hissing of a large serpent, which they observed revolving itself
towards them with great velocity.&nbsp; Terrified at the sight, Michael&rsquo;s
two companions fled, while he, on the contrary, resolved to encounter
the reptile.&nbsp; The appalling monster approached Michael Scott with
distended mouth and forked tongue; and, throwing itself into a coil
at his feet, was raising its head to inflict a mortal sting, when Michael,
with one stroke of his stick, severed its body into three pieces.&nbsp;
Having rejoined <!-- page 56--><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>his
affrighted comrades, they resumed their journey; and, on arriving at
the next public-house, it being late, and the travellers being weary,
they took up their quarters at it for the night.&nbsp; In the course
of the night&rsquo;s conversation, reference was naturally made to Michael&rsquo;s
recent exploit with the serpent, when the landlady of the house, who
was remarkable for her &ldquo;arts,&rdquo; happened to be present.&nbsp;
Her curiosity appeared much excited by the conversation; and, after
making some inquiries regarding the colour of the serpent, which she
was told was white, she offered any of them that would procure her the
middle piece such a tempting reward, as induced one of the party instantly
to go for it.&nbsp; The distance was not very great; and on reaching
the spot, he found the middle and tail piece in the place where Michael
left them, but the head piece was gone.</p>
<p>The landlady on receiving the piece, which still vibrated with life,
seemed highly gratified at her acquisition; and, over and above the
promised reward, regaled her lodgers very plentifully with the choicest
dainties in her house.&nbsp; Fired with curiosity to know the purpose
for which the serpent was intended, the wily Michael Scott was immediately
seized with a severe fit of indisposition, which caused him to prefer
the request that he might be allowed to sleep beside the fire, the warmth
of which, he affirmed, was in the highest degree beneficial to him.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Never suspecting
Michael Scott&rsquo;s hypocrisy, and naturally supposing that a person
so severely indisposed would feel very little curiosity about the contents
of any cooking utensils which might lie around the fire, the landlady
allowed his request.&nbsp; As soon as the other inmates of the house
were retired to bed, the landlady resorted to her darling occupation;
and, in his feigned state of indisposition, Michael had a favourable
opportunity of watching most scrupulously all her actions through the
keyhole of a door leading to the next apartment where she was.&nbsp;
He could see the rites and ceremonies with which the serpent was put
into the oven, along with many mysterious ingredients.&nbsp; After which
the unsuspicious landlady placed the dish by the fireside, where lay
the distressed traveller, to stove till the morning.</p>
<p>Once or twice in the course of the night the &ldquo;wife of the change-house,&rdquo;
under the pretence of inquiring for her sick lodger, and administering
to him some renovating cordials, the beneficial effects of which he
gratefully acknowledged, took occasion to dip her finger in her saucepan,
upon which the cock, perched on his roost, crowed aloud.&nbsp; All Michael&rsquo;s
sickness could not prevent him considering very inquisitively the landlady&rsquo;s
cantrips, and particularly the influence of the sauce upon the crowing
of the cock.&nbsp; Nor could he dissipate some inward desires he felt
to follow her example.&nbsp; At <!-- page 58--><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the
same time, he suspected that Satan had a hand in the pie, yet he thought
he would like very much to be at the bottom of the concern; and thus
his reason and his curiosity clashed against each other for the space
of several hours.&nbsp; At length passion, as is too often the case,
became the conqueror.&nbsp; Michael, too, dipped his finger in the sauce,
and applied it to the tip of his tongue, and immediately the cock perched
on the <i>spardan</i> announced the circumstance in a mournful clarion.&nbsp;
Instantly his mind received a new light to which he was formerly a stranger,
and the astonished dupe of a landlady now found it her interest to admit
her sagacious lodger into a knowledge of the remainder of her secrets.</p>
<p>Endowed with the knowledge of &ldquo;good and evil,&rdquo; and all
the &ldquo;second sights&rdquo; that can be acquired, Michael left his
lodgings in the morning, with the philosopher&rsquo;s stone in his pocket.&nbsp;
By daily perfecting his supernatural attainments, by new series of discoveries,
he became more than a match for Satan himself.&nbsp; Having seduced
some thousands of Satan&rsquo;s best workmen into his employment, he
trained them up so successfully to the architective business, and inspired
them with such industrious habits, that he was more than sufficient
for all the architectural work of the empire.&nbsp; To establish this
assertion, we need only refer to some remains of his workmanship still
existing north of the Grampians, some of them, stupendous bridges built
by him in one short night, <!-- page 59--><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>with
no other visible agents than two or three workmen.</p>
<p>On one occasion work was getting scarce, as might have been naturally
expected, and his workmen, as they were wont, flocked to his doors,
perpetually exclaiming, &ldquo;Work! work! work!&rdquo;&nbsp; Continually
annoyed by their incessant entreaties, he called out to them in derision
to go and make a dry road from Fortrose to Arderseir, over the Moray
Firth.&nbsp; Immediately their cry ceased, and as Scott supposed it
wholly impossible for them to execute his order, he retired to rest,
laughing most heartily at the chimerical sort of employment he had given
to his industrious workmen.&nbsp; Early in the morning, however, he
got up and took a walk at the break of day down to the shore to divert
himself at the fruitless labours of his zealous workmen.&nbsp; But on
reaching the spot, what was his astonishment to find the formidable
piece of work allotted to them only a few hours before already nearly
finished.&nbsp; Seeing the great damage the commercial class of the
community would sustain from the operation, he ordered the workmen to
demolish the most part of their work; leaving, however, the point of
Fortrose to show the traveller to this day the wonderful exploit of
Michael Scott&rsquo;s fairies.</p>
<p>On being thus again thrown out of employment, their former clamour
was resumed, nor could Michael Scott, with all his sagacity, devise
a plan to keep <!-- page 60--><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>them
in innocent employment.&nbsp; He at length discovered one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;and manufacture me ropes that will carry me to the back
of the moon, of these materials&mdash;<i>miller&rsquo;s-sudds</i> and
sea-sand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Michael Scott here obtained rest from his active
operators; for, when other work failed them, he always despatched them
to their rope manufactory.&nbsp; But though these agents could never
make proper ropes of those materials, their efforts to that effect are
far from being contemptible, for some of their ropes are seen by the
sea-side to this day.</p>
<p>We shall close our notice of Michael Scott by reciting one anecdote
of him in the latter part of his life.</p>
<p>In consequence of a violent quarrel which Michael Scott once had
with a person whom he conceived to have caused him some injury, he resolved,
as the highest punishment he could inflict upon him, to send his adversary
to that evil place designed only for Satan and his black companions.&nbsp;
He accordingly, by means of his supernatural machinations, sent the
poor unfortunate man thither; and had he been sent by any other means
than those of Michael Scott, he would no doubt have met with a warm
reception.&nbsp; Out of pure spite to Michael, however, when Satan learned
who was his billet-master, he would no more receive him than he would
receive the Wife of Beth; and instead of treating the unfortunate man
with the harshness characteristic <!-- page 61--><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>of
him, he showed him considerable civilities.&nbsp; Introducing him to
his &ldquo;Ben Taigh,&rdquo; he directed her to show the stranger any
curiosities he might wish to see, hinting very significantly that he
had provided some accommodation for their mutual friend, Michael Scott,
the sight of which might afford him some gratification.&nbsp; The polite
housekeeper accordingly conducted the stranger through the principal
apartments in the house, where he saw fearful sights.&nbsp; But the
bed of Michael Scott!&mdash;his greatest enemy could not but feel satiated
with revenge at the sight of it.&nbsp; It was a place too horrid to
be described, filled promiscuously with all the awful brutes imaginable.&nbsp;
Toads and lions, lizards and leeches, and, amongst the rest, not the
least conspicuous, a large serpent gaping for Michael Scott, with its
mouth wide open.&nbsp; This last sight having satisfied the stranger&rsquo;s
curiosity, he was led to the outer gate, and came away.&nbsp; He reached
his friends, and, among other pieces of news touching his travels, he
was not backward in relating the entertainment that awaited his friend
Michael Scott, as soon as he would &ldquo;stretch his foot&rdquo; for
the other world.&nbsp; But Michael did not at all appear disconcerted
at his friend&rsquo;s intelligence.&nbsp; He affirmed that he would
disappoint all his enemies in their expectations&mdash;in proof of which
he gave the following signs: &ldquo;When I am just dead,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;open my breast and extract my heart.&nbsp; Carry it to some
place where <!-- page 62--><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the public
may see the result.&nbsp; You will then transfix it upon a long pole,
and if Satan will have my soul, he will come in the likeness of a black
raven and carry it off; and if my soul will be saved it will be carried
off by a white dove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His friends faithfully obeyed his instructions.&nbsp; Having exhibited
his heart in the manner directed, a large black raven was observed to
come from the east with great fleetness, while a white dove came from
the west with equal velocity.&nbsp; The raven made a furious dash at
the heart, missing which, it was unable to curb its force, till it was
considerably past it; and the dove, reaching the spot at the same time,
carried off the heart amidst the rejoicing and ejaculations of the spectators.</p>
<h2><!-- page 63--><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>THE MINISTER AND
THE FAIRY.</h2>
<p>Not long since, a pious clergyman was returning home, after administering
spiritual consolation to a dying member of his flock.&nbsp; It was late
of the night, and he had to pass through a good deal of <i>uncanny</i>
land.&nbsp; He was, however, a good and a conscientious minister of
the Gospel, and feared not all the spirits in the country.&nbsp; On
his reaching the end of a lake which stretched along the roadside for
some distance, he was a good deal surprised at hearing the most melodious
strains of music.&nbsp; Overcome by pleasure and curiosity, the minister
coolly sat down to listen to the harmonious sounds, and try what new
discoveries he could make with regard to their nature and source.&nbsp;
He had not sat many minutes before he could distinguish the approach
of the music, and also observe a light in the direction from whence
it proceeded gliding across the lake towards him.&nbsp; Instead of taking
to his heels, as any faithless wight would have done, the pastor fearlessly
determined to await the issue of the phenomenon.&nbsp; As the light
and music drew near, the clergyman could at <!-- page 64--><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>length
distinguish an object resembling a human being walking on the surface
of the water, attended by a group of diminutive musicians, some of them
bearing lights, and others instruments of music, from which they continued
to evoke those melodious strains which first attracted his attention.&nbsp;
The leader of the band dismissed his attendants, landed on the beach,
and afforded the minister the amplest opportunities of examining his
appearance.&nbsp; He was a little primitive-looking grey-headed man,
clad in the most grotesque habit the clergyman had ever seen, and such
as led him at once to suspect his real character.&nbsp; He walked up
to the minister, whom he saluted with great grace, offering an apology
for his intrusion.&nbsp; The pastor returned his compliments, and, without
further explanation, invited the mysterious stranger to sit down by
his side.&nbsp; The invitation was complied with, upon which the minister
proposed the following question:&mdash;&ldquo;Who art thou, stranger,
and from whence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question the fairy, with downcast eye, replied that he was
one of those sometimes called <i>Doane Shee</i>, or men of peace, or
good men, though the reverse of this title was a more fit appellation
for them.&nbsp; Originally angelic in his nature and attributes, and
once a sharer of the indescribable joys of the regions of light, he
was seduced by Satan to join him in his mad conspiracies; and, as a
punishment for his transgression, he was cast down <!-- page 65--><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>from
those regions of bliss, and was now doomed, along with millions of fellow-sufferers,
to wander through seas and mountains, until the coming of the Great
Day.&nbsp; What their fate would be then they could not divine, but
they apprehended the worst.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued he, turning
to the minister, with great anxiety, &ldquo;the object of my present
intrusion on you is to learn your opinion, as an eminent divine, as
to our final condition on that dreadful day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the venerable
pastor entered upon a long conversation with the fairy, touching the
principles of faith and repentance.&nbsp; Receiving rather unsatisfactory
answers to his questions, the minister desired the &ldquo;sheech&rdquo;
to repeat after him the Paternoster, in attempting to do which, it was
not a little remarkable that he could not repeat the word &ldquo;art,&rdquo;
but said &ldquo;<i>wert</i>,&rdquo; in heaven.&nbsp; Inferring from
every circumstance that their fate was extremely precarious, the minister
resolved not to puff the fairies up with presumptuous, and, perhaps,
groundless expectations.&nbsp; Accordingly, addressing himself to the
unhappy fairy, who was all anxiety to know the nature of his sentiments,
the reverend gentleman told him that he could not take it upon him to
give them any hopes of pardon, as their crime was of so deep a hue as
scarcely to admit of it.&nbsp; On this the unhappy fairy uttered a shriek
of despair, plunged headlong into the loch, and the minister resumed
his course to his home.</p>
<h2><!-- page 66--><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>THE FISHERMAN AND
THE MERMAN.</h2>
<p>Of mermen and merwomen many strange stories are told in the Shetland
Isles.&nbsp; Beneath the depths of the ocean, according to these stories,
an atmosphere exists adapted to the respiratory organs of certain beings,
resembling, in form, the human race, possessed of surpassing beauty,
of limited supernatural powers, and liable to the incident of death.&nbsp;
They dwell in a wide territory of the globe, far below the region of
fishes, over which the sea, like the cloudy canopy of our sky, loftily
rolls, and they possess habitations constructed of the pearl and coral
productions of the ocean.&nbsp; Having lungs not adapted to a watery
medium, but to the nature of atmospheric air, it would be impossible
for them to pass through the volume of waters that intervenes between
the submarine and supramarine world, if it were not for the extraordinary
power they inherit of entering the skin of some animal capable of existing
in the sea, which they are enabled to occupy by a sort of demoniacal
possession.&nbsp; One shape they put on, is that of an animal human
above the waist, <!-- page 67--><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>yet
terminating below in the tail and fins of a fish, but the most favourite
form is that of the larger seal or Haaf-fish; for, in possessing an
amphibious nature, they are enabled not only to exist in the ocean,
but to land on some rock, where they frequently lighten themselves of
their sea-dress, resume their proper shape, and with much curiosity
examine the nature of the upper world belonging to the human race.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, however, each merman or merwoman possesses but one skin,
enabling the individual to ascend the seas, and if, on visiting the
abode of man, the garb be lost, the hapless being must unavoidably become
an inhabitant of the earth.</p>
<p>A story is told of a boat&rsquo;s crew who landed for the purpose
of attacking the seals lying in the hollows of the crags at one of the
stacks.&nbsp; The men stunned a number of the animals, and while they
were in this state stripped them of their skins, with the fat attached
to them.&nbsp; Leaving the carcasses on the rock, the crew were about
to set off for the shore of Papa Stour, when such a tremendous swell
arose that every one flew quickly to the boat.&nbsp; All succeeded in
entering it except one man, who had imprudently lingered behind.&nbsp;
The crew were unwilling to leave a companion to perish on the skerries,
but the surge increased so fast, that after many unsuccessful attempts
to bring the boat close in to the stack the unfortunate wight was left
to his fate.&nbsp; A stormy night came on, and the deserted <!-- page 68--><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Shetlander
saw no prospect before him but that of perishing from cold and hunger,
or of being washed into the sea by the breakers which threatened to
dash over the rocks.&nbsp; At length, he perceived many of the seals,
who, in their flight had escaped the attack of the boatmen, approach
the skerry, disrobe themselves of their amphibious hides, and resume
the shape of the sons and daughters of the ocean.&nbsp; Their first
object was to assist in the recovery of their friends, who having been
stunned by clubs, had, while in that state, been deprived of their skins.&nbsp;
When the flayed animals had regained their sensibility, they assumed
their proper form of mermen or merwomen, and began to lament in a mournful
lay, wildly accompanied by the storm that was raging around, the loss
of their sea-dress, which would prevent them from again enjoying their
native azure atmosphere, and coral mansions that lay below the deep
waters of the Atlantic.&nbsp; But their chief lamentation was for Ollavitinus,
the son of Gioga, who, having been stripped of his seal&rsquo;s skin,
would be for ever parted from his mates, and condemned to become an
outcast inhabitant of the upper world.&nbsp; Their song was at length
broken off, by observing one of their enemies viewing, with shivering
limbs and looks of comfortless despair, the wild waves that dashed over
the stack.&nbsp; Gioga immediately conceived the idea of rendering subservient
to the advantage of the son the perilous situation of the man.&nbsp;
<!-- page 69--><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>She addressed him with
mildness, proposing to carry him safe on her back across the sea to
Papa Stour, on condition of receiving the seal-skin of Ollavitinus.&nbsp;
A bargain was struck, and Gioga clad herself in her amphibious garb;
but the Shetlander, alarmed at the sight of the stormy main that he
was to ride through, prudently begged leave of the matron, for his better
preservation, that he might be allowed to cut a few holes in her shoulders
and flanks, in order to procure, between the skin and the flesh, a better
fastening for his hands and feet.&nbsp; The request being complied with,
the man grasped the neck of the seal, and committing himself to her
care, she landed him safely at Acres Gio in Papa Stour; from which place
he immediately repaired to a skeo at Hamna Voe, where the skin was deposited,
and honourably fulfilled his part of the contract, by affording Gioga
the means whereby her son could again revisit the ethereal space over
which the sea spread its green mantle.</p>
<h2><!-- page 70--><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>THE LAIRD O&rsquo;
CO&rsquo;.</h2>
<p>In the days of yore, the proprietors of Colzean, in Ayrshire (ancestors
of the Marquis of Ailsa), were known in that country by the title of
Lairds o&rsquo; Co&rsquo;, a name bestowed on Colzean from some co&rsquo;s
(or coves) in the rock beneath the castle.</p>
<p>One morning, a very little boy, carrying a small wooden can, addressed
the Laird near the castle gate, begging for a little ale for his mother,
who was sick.&nbsp; The Laird directed him to go to the butler and get
his can filled; so away he went as ordered.&nbsp; The butler had a barrel
of ale on tap, but about half full, out of which he proceeded to fill
the boy&rsquo;s can; but to his extreme surprise he emptied the cask,
and still the little can was not nearly full.&nbsp; The butler was unwilling
to broach another barrel, but the little fellow insisted on the fulfilment
of the Laird&rsquo;s order, and a reference was made to the Laird by
the butler, who stated the miraculous capacity of the tiny can, and
received instant orders to fill it if all the ale in the cellar would
suffice.&nbsp; Obedient to this command, he broached another cask, but
had <!-- page 71--><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>scarcely drawn
a drop when the can was full, and the dwarf departed with expressions
of gratitude.</p>
<p>Some years afterwards the Laird being at the wars in Flanders was
taken prisoner, and for some reason or other (probably as a spy) condemned
to die a felon&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The night prior to the day for his
execution, being confined in a dungeon strongly barricaded, the doors
suddenly flew open, and the dwarf reappeared, saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Laird o&rsquo; Co&rsquo;,<br />
Rise an&rsquo; go.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a summons too welcome to require repetition.</p>
<p>On emerging from prison, the boy caused him to mount on his shoulders,
and in a short time set him down at his own gate, on the very spot where
they had formerly met, saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ae gude turn deserves anither&mdash;<br />
Tak&rsquo; ye that for being sae kin&rsquo; to my auld mither,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and vanished.</p>
<h2><!-- page 72--><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>EWEN OF THE LITTLE
HEAD.</h2>
<p>About three hundred years ago, Ewen Maclaine of Lochbuy, in the island
of Mull, having been engaged in a quarrel with a neighbouring chief,
a day was fixed for determining the affair by the sword.&nbsp; Lochbuy,
before the day arrived, consulted a celebrated witch as to the result
of the feud.&nbsp; The witch declared that if Lochbuy&rsquo;s wife should
on the morning of that day give him and his men food unasked, he would
be victorious, but if not, the result would be the reverse.&nbsp; This
was a disheartening response for the unhappy votary, his wife being
a noted shrew.</p>
<p>The fatal morning arrived, and the hour for meeting the enemy approached,
but there appeared no symptoms of refreshment for Lochbuy and his men.&nbsp;
At length the unfortunate man was compelled to ask his wife to supply
them with food.&nbsp; She set down before them curds, but without spoons.&nbsp;
When the husband inquired how they were to eat them, she replied they
should assume the bills of hens.&nbsp; The men ate the curds, as well
as they could, with their hands; but Lochbuy himself ate none.&nbsp;
After <!-- page 73--><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>behaving with
the greatest bravery in the bloody conflict which ensued, he fell covered
with wounds, leaving his wife to the execration of the people.&nbsp;
She is still known in that district under the appellation of Corr-dhu,
or the Black Crane.</p>
<p>But the miseries brought on the luckless Lochbuy by his wife did
not end with his life, for he died fasting, and his ghost is frequently
seen to this day riding the very horse on which he was mounted when
he was killed.&nbsp; It was a small, but very neat and active pony,
dun or mouse-coloured, to which the Laird was much attached, and on
which he had ridden for many years before his death.&nbsp; Its appearance
is as accurately described in the island of Mull as any steed is at
Newmarket.&nbsp; The prints of its shoes are discerned by connoisseurs,
and the rattling of its curb is recognised in the darkest night.&nbsp;
It is not particular with regard to roads, for it goes up hill and down
dale with equal velocity.&nbsp; Its hard-fated rider still wears the
same green cloak which covered him in his last battle; and he is particularly
distinguished by the small size of his head, a peculiarity which, we
suspect, the learned disciples of Spurzheim have never yet had the sagacity
to discover as indicative of an extraordinary talent and incomparable
perseverance in horsemanship.</p>
<p>It is now above three hundred years since Ewen-a-chin-vig (<i>Anglice</i>,
Hugh of the Little Head) fell in the field of honour; but neither the
vigour of the <!-- page 74--><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>horse
nor of the rider is yet diminished.&nbsp; His mournful duty has always
been to attend the dying moments of every member of his own tribe, and
to escort the departed spirit on its long and arduous journey.&nbsp;
He has been seen in the remotest of the Hebrides; and he has found his
way to Ireland on these occasions long before steam navigation was invented.&nbsp;
About a century ago he took a fancy for a young man of his own race,
and frequently did him the honour of placing him behind himself on horseback.&nbsp;
He entered into conversation with him, and foretold many circumstances
connected with the fate of his successors, which have undoubtedly since
come to pass.</p>
<p>Many a long winter night have I listened to the feats of Ewen-a-chin-vig,
the faithful and indefatigable guardian of his ancient family, in the
hour of their last and greatest trial, affording an example worthy the
imitation of every chief,&mdash;perhaps not beneath the notice of Glengarry
himself.</p>
<p>About a dozen years since some symptoms of Ewen&rsquo;s decay gave
very general alarm to his friends.&nbsp; He accosted one of his own
people (indeed he never has been known to notice any other), and, shaking
him cordially by the hand, he attempted to place him on the saddle behind
him, but the uncourteous dog declined the honour.&nbsp; Ewen struggled
hard, but the clown was a great, strong, clumsy fellow, and stuck to
the earth with all his might.&nbsp; He <!-- page 75--><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>candidly
acknowledged, however, that his chief would have prevailed, had it not
been for a birch-tree which stood by, and which he got within the fold
of his left arm.&nbsp; The contest became very warm indeed, and the
tree was certainly twisted like an osier, as thousands can testify who
saw it as well as myself.&nbsp; At length, however, Ewen lost his seat
for the first time, and the instant the pony found he was his own master,
he set off with the fleetness of lightning.&nbsp; Ewen immediately pursued
his steed, and the wearied rustic sped his way homeward.&nbsp; It was
the general opinion that Ewen found considerable difficulty in catching
the horse; but I am happy to learn that he has been lately seen riding
the old mouse-coloured pony without the least change in either the horse
or the rider.&nbsp; Long may he continue to do so!</p>
<p>Those who from motives of piety or curiosity have visited the sacred
island of Iona, must remember to have seen the guide point out the tomb
of Ewen, with his figure on horseback, very elegantly sculptured in
alto-relievo, and many of the above facts are on such occasions related.</p>
<h2><!-- page 76--><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>JOCK AND HIS MOTHER.</h2>
<p>Ye see, there was a wife had a son, and they called him Jock; and

So he carried the pack, and got the needle; and as he was gaun awa&rsquo;
hame to his mither, he cuts a burden o&rsquo; brackens, and put the
needle into the heart o&rsquo; them.&nbsp; Awa&rsquo; he gaes hame.&nbsp;
Says his mither, &ldquo;What hae ye made o&rsquo; yoursel&rsquo; the

&ldquo;If ye help me to carry my socks a&rsquo; day, I&rsquo;ll gie

that,&rdquo; quo&rsquo; Jock.&nbsp; Jock carried them a&rsquo; day,
and got a <!-- page 77--><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>sock, which
he stuck in his bonnet.&nbsp; On the way hame, Jock was dry, and gaed
away to take a drink out o&rsquo; the burn; and wi&rsquo; the weight
o&rsquo; the sock, his bonnet fell into the river, and gaed out o&rsquo;
sight.&nbsp; He gaed hame, and his mither says, &ldquo;Weel, Jock, what
hae you been doing a&rsquo; day?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he tells her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hout,&rdquo; quo&rsquo; she, &ldquo;you should hae tied the string
to it, and trailed it behind you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; quo&rsquo;
Jock, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mind that again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Awa&rsquo; he sets, and he fa&rsquo;s in wi&rsquo; a flesher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; says the flesher, &ldquo;if ye&rsquo;ll be my servant
a&rsquo; day, I&rsquo;ll gie ye a leg o&rsquo; mutton at night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be that,&rdquo; quo&rsquo; Jock.&nbsp; He got a leg
o&rsquo; mutton at night.&nbsp; He ties a string to it, and trails it
behind him the hale road hame.&nbsp; &ldquo;What hae ye been doing?&rdquo;
said his mither.&nbsp; He tells her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hout, you fool, ye
should hae carried it on your shouther.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll

<p>Awa&rsquo; he gaes next day, and meets a horse-dealer.&nbsp; He says,
&ldquo;If you will help me wi&rsquo; my horses a&rsquo; day, I&rsquo;ll
give you ane to yoursel&rsquo; at night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
do that,&rdquo; quo&rsquo; Jock.&nbsp; So he served him, and got his
horse, and he ties its feet; but as he was not able to carry it on his
back, he left it lying on the roadside.&nbsp; Hame he comes, and tells
his mither.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hout, ye daft gowk, ye&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er
turn wise!&nbsp; Could ye no hae loupen on it, and ridden it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mind that again,&rdquo; quo&rsquo; Jock.</p>
<p>Aweel, there was a grand gentleman, wha had a <!-- page 78--><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>daughter
wha was very subject to melancholy; and her father gae out that whaever
should mak&rsquo; her laugh would get her in marriage.&nbsp; So it happened
that she was sitting at the window ae day, musing in her melancholy
state, when Jock, according to the advice o&rsquo; his mither, cam&rsquo;
flying up on a cow&rsquo;s back, wi&rsquo; the tail over his shouther.&nbsp;
And she burst out into a fit o&rsquo; laughter.&nbsp; When they made
inquiry wha made her laugh, it was found to be Jock riding on the cow.&nbsp;
Accordingly, Jock was sent for to get his bride.&nbsp; Weel, Jock was
married to her, and there was a great supper prepared.&nbsp; Amongst
the rest o&rsquo; the things, there was some honey, which Jock was very
fond o&rsquo;.&nbsp; After supper, they all retired, and the auld priest
that married them sat up a&rsquo; night by the kitchen fireside.&nbsp;
So Jock waukens in the night-time, and says, &ldquo;Oh, wad ye gie me
some o&rsquo; yon nice sweet honey that we got to our supper last night?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh ay,&rdquo; says his wife, &ldquo;rise and gang into the press,
and ye&rsquo;ll get a pig fou o &rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jock rose, and
thrust his hand into the honey-pig for a nievefu&rsquo; o &rsquo;t,
and he could not get it out.&nbsp; So he cam&rsquo; awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
the pig in his hand, like a mason&rsquo;s mell, and says, &ldquo;Oh,
I canna get my hand out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hoot,&rdquo; quo&rsquo;
she, &ldquo;gang awa&rsquo; and break it on the cheek-stane.&rdquo;&nbsp;
By this time, the fire was dark, and the auld priest was lying snoring
wi&rsquo; his head against the chimney-piece, wi&rsquo; a huge white
wig on.&nbsp; Jock gaes awa&rsquo;, and gae him a whack wi&rsquo; the
honey-pig on the <!-- page 79--><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>head,
thinking it was the cheek-stane, and knocks it a&rsquo; in bits.&nbsp;
The auld priest roars out, &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;&nbsp; Jock tak&rsquo;s
doun the stair as hard as he could bicker, and hides himsel&rsquo; amang
the bees&rsquo; skeps.</p>
<p>That night, as luck wad have it, some thieves cam&rsquo; to steal
the bees&rsquo; skeps, and in the hurry o&rsquo; tumbling them into
a large grey plaid, they tumbled Jock in alang wi&rsquo; them.&nbsp;
So aff they set, wi&rsquo; Jock and the skeps on their backs.&nbsp;
On the way, they had to cross the burn where Jock lost his bonnet.&nbsp;
Ane o&rsquo; the thieves cries, &ldquo;Oh, I hae fand a bonnet!&rdquo;
and Jock, on hearing that, cries out, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They thocht they had got the deil on their backs.&nbsp; So they let
a&rsquo; fa&rsquo; in the burn; and Jock, being tied in the plaid, couldna
get out; so he and the bees were a&rsquo; drowned thegither.</p>
<p>If a&rsquo; tales be true, that&rsquo;s nae lee.</p>
<h2><!-- page 80--><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>SAINT COLUMBA.</h2>
<p>Soon after Saint Columba established his residence in Iona, tradition
says that he paid a visit to a great seminary of Druids, then in the
vicinity, at a place called Camusnan Ceul, or Bay of Cells, in the district
of Ardnamurchan.&nbsp; Several remains of Druidical circles are still
to be seen there, and on that bay and the neighbourhood many places
are still named after their rites and ceremonies; such as <i>Ardintibert</i>,
the Mount of Sacrifice, and others.&nbsp; The fame of the Saint had
been for some time well known to the people, and his intention of instructing
them in the doctrines of Christianity was announced to them.&nbsp; The
ancient priesthood made every exertion to dissuade the inhabitants from
hearing the powerful eloquence of Columba, and in this they were seconded
by the principal man then in that country, whose name was Donald, a
son of Connal.</p>
<p>The Saint had no sooner made his appearance, however, than he was
surrounded by a vast multitude, anxious to hear so celebrated a preacher;
and after the sermon was ended, many persons expressed <!-- page 81--><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>a
desire to be baptized, in spite of the remonstrances of the Druids.&nbsp;
Columba had made choice of an eminence centrally situated for performing
worship; but there was no water near the spot, and the son of Connal
threatened with punishment any who should dare to procure it for his
purpose.&nbsp; The Saint stood with his back leaning on a rock; after
a short prayer, he struck the rock with his foot, and a stream of water
issued forth in great abundance.&nbsp; The miracle had a powerful effect
on the minds of his hearers, and many became converts to the new religion.&nbsp;
This fountain is still distinguished by the name of Columba, and is
considered of superior efficacy in the cure of diseases.&nbsp; When
the Catholic form of worship prevailed in that country it was greatly
resorted to, and old persons yet remember to have seen offerings left
at the fountain in gratitude for benefits received from the benignant
influence of the Saint&rsquo;s blessing on the water.&nbsp; At length
it is said that a daughter of Donald, the son of Connal, expressed a
wish to be baptized, and the father restrained her by violence.&nbsp;
He also, with the aid of the Druids, forced Columba to take refuge in
his boat, and the holy man departed for Iona, after warning the inhospitable
Caledonian to prepare for another world, as his life would soon terminate.</p>
<p>The Saint was at sea during the whole night, which was stormy; and
when approaching the shores of his own sacred island the following <!-- page 82--><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>morning,
a vast number of ravens were observed flying over the boat, chasing
another of extraordinary large size.&nbsp; The croaking of the ravens
awoke the Saint, who had been sleeping; and he instantly exclaimed that
the son of Connal had just expired, which was afterwards ascertained
to be true.</p>
<p>A very large Christian establishment appears to have been afterwards
formed in the Bay of Cells; and the remains of a chapel, dedicated to
Saint Kiaran, are still to be seen there.&nbsp; It is the favourite
place of interment among the Catholics of this day.&nbsp; Indeed, Columba
and many of his successors seem to have adopted the policy of engrafting
their institutions on those which had formerly existed in the country.&nbsp;
Of this there are innumerable instances, at least we observe the ruins
of both still visible in many places; even in Iona we find the burying-ground
of the Druids known at the present day.&nbsp; This practice may have
had advantages at the time, but it must have been ultimately productive
of many corruptions; and, in a great measure, accounts for many superstitious
and absurd customs which prevailed among that people to a very recent
period, and which are not yet entirely extinct.&nbsp; In a very ancient
family in that country two round balls of coarse glass have been carefully
preserved from time immemorial, and to these have been ascribed many
virtues&mdash;amongst others, the cure of any extraordinary disease
among cattle.&nbsp; The balls were immersed <!-- page 83--><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>in
cold water for three days and nights, and the water was afterwards sprinkled
over all the cattle; this was expected to cure those affected, and to
prevent the disease in the rest.&nbsp; From the names and appearance
of these balls, there is no doubt that they had been symbols used by
the Archdruids.</p>
<p>Within a short distance of the Bay of Cells there is a cave very
remarkable in its appearance, and still more so from the purposes to
which it has been appropriated.&nbsp; Saint Columba, on one of his many
voyages among the Hebrides, was benighted on this rocky coast, and the
mariners were alarmed for their own safety.&nbsp; The Saint assured
them that neither he nor his crew would ever be drowned.&nbsp; They
unexpectedly discovered a light at no great distance, and to that they
directed their course.&nbsp; Columba&rsquo;s boat consisted of a frame
of osiers, which was covered with hides of leather, and it was received
into a very narrow creek close to this cave.&nbsp; After returning thanks
for their escape, the Saint and his people had great difficulty in climbing
up to the cave, which is elevated considerably above sea.&nbsp; They
at length got sight of the fire which had first attracted their attention.&nbsp;
Several persons sat around it, and their appearance was not much calculated
to please the holy man.&nbsp; Their aspects were fierce, and they had
on the fire some flesh roasting over the coals.&nbsp; The Saint gave
them his benediction; and he was invited to sit down among them and
to share <!-- page 84--><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>their hurried
repast, with which he gladly complied.&nbsp; They were freebooters,
who lived by plunder and robbery, and this Columba soon discovered.&nbsp;
He advised them to forsake that course, and to be converted to his doctrines,
to which they all assented, and in the morning they accompanied the
Saint on his voyage homeward.&nbsp; This circumstance created a high
veneration for the cave among the disciples and successors of Columba,
and that veneration still continues, in some degree.&nbsp; In one side
of it there was a cleft of the rock, where lay the water with which
the freebooters had been baptized; and this was afterwards formed by
art into a basin, which is supplied with water by drops from the roof
of the cave.&nbsp; It is alleged never to be empty or to overflow, and
the most salubrious qualities are ascribed to it.&nbsp; To obtain the
benefit of it, however, the votaries must undergo a very severe ordeal.&nbsp;
They must be in the cave before daylight; they stand on the spot where
the Saint first landed his boat, and nine waves must dash over their
heads; they must afterwards pass through nine openings in the walls
of the cave; and, lastly, they must swallow nine mouthfuls out of the
holy basin.&nbsp; After invoking the aid of the Saint, the votaries
within three weeks are either relieved by death or by recovery.&nbsp;
Offerings are left in a certain place appropriated for that purpose;
and these are sometimes of considerable value, nor are they <!-- page 85--><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>ever
abstracted.&nbsp; Strangers are always informed that a young man, who
had wantonly taken away some of these not many years since, broke his
leg before he got home, and this affords the property of the Saint ample
protection.</p>
<h2><!-- page 86--><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>THE MERMAID WIFE.</h2>
<p>A story is told of an inhabitant of Unst, who, in walking on the
sandy margin of a voe, saw a number of mermen and mermaids dancing by
moonlight, and several seal-skins strewed beside them on the ground.&nbsp;
At his approach they immediately fled to secure their garbs, and, taking
upon themselves the form of seals, plunged immediately into the sea.&nbsp;
But as the Shetlander perceived that one skin lay close to his feet,
he snatched it up, bore it swiftly away, and placed it in concealment.&nbsp;
On returning to the shore he met the fairest damsel that was ever gazed
upon by mortal eyes, lamenting the robbery, by which she had become
an exile from her submarine friends, and a tenant of the upper world.&nbsp;
Vainly she implored the restitution of her property; the man had drunk
deeply of love, and was inexorable; but he offered her protection beneath
his roof as his betrothed spouse.&nbsp; The merlady, perceiving that
she must become an inhabitant of the earth, found that she could not
do better than accept of the offer.&nbsp; This strange attachment <!-- page 87--><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>subsisted
for many years, and the couple had several children.&nbsp; The Shetlander&rsquo;s
love for his merwife was unbounded, but his affection was coldly returned.&nbsp;
The lady would often steal alone to the desert strand, and, on a signal
being given, a large seal would make his appearance, with whom she would
hold, in an unknown tongue, an anxious conference.&nbsp; Years had thus
glided away, when it happened that one of the children, in the course
of his play, found concealed beneath a stack of corn a seal&rsquo;s
skin; and, delighted with the prize, he ran with it to his mother.&nbsp;
Her eyes glistened with rapture&mdash;she gazed upon it as her own&mdash;as
the means by which she could pass through the ocean that led to her
native home.&nbsp; She burst forth into an ecstasy of joy, which was
only moderated when she beheld her children, whom she was now about
to leave; and, after hastily embracing them, she fled with all speed
towards the sea-side.&nbsp; The husband immediately returned, learned
the discovery that had taken place, ran to overtake his wife, but only
arrived in time to see her transformation of shape completed&mdash;to
see her, in the form of a seal, bound from the ledge of a rock into
the sea.&nbsp; The large animal of the same kind with whom she had held
a secret converse soon appeared, and evidently congratulated her, in
the most tender manner, on her escape.&nbsp; But before she dived to
unknown depths, she cast a parting glance at the wretched Shetlander,
<!-- page 88--><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>whose despairing looks
excited in her breast a few transient feelings of commiseration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; said she to him, &ldquo;and may all good
attend you.&nbsp; I loved you very well when I resided upon earth, but
I always loved my first husband much better.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 89--><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>THE FIDDLER AND
THE BOGLE OF BOGANDORAN.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Late one night, as my grand-uncle, Lachlan Dhu Macpherson,
who was well known as the best fiddler of his day, was returning home
from a ball, at which he had acted as a musician, he had occasion to
pass through the once-haunted Bog of Torrans.&nbsp; Now, it happened
at that time that the bog was frequented by a huge bogle or ghost, who
was of a most mischievous disposition, and took particular pleasure
in abusing every traveller who had occasion to pass through the place
betwixt the twilight at night and cock-crowing in the morning.&nbsp;
Suspecting much that he would also come in for a share of his abuse,
my grand-uncle made up his mind, in the course of his progress, to return
the ghost any <i>civilities</i> which he might think meet to offer him.&nbsp;
On arriving on the spot, he found his suspicions were too well grounded;
for whom did he see but the ghost of Bogandoran apparently ready waiting
him, and seeming by his ghastly grin not a little overjoyed at the meeting.&nbsp;
Marching up to my <!-- page 90--><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>grand-uncle,
the bogle clapped a huge club into his hand, and furnishing himself
with one of the same dimensions, he put a spittle in his hand, and deliberately
commenced the combat.&nbsp; My grand-uncle returned the salute with
equal spirit, and so ably did both parties ply their batons that for
a while the issue of the combat was extremely doubtful.&nbsp; At length,
however, the fiddler could easily discover that his opponent&rsquo;s
vigour was much in the fagging order.&nbsp; Picking up renewed courage
in consequence, he plied the ghost with renewed force, and after a stout
resistance, in the course of which both parties were seriously handled,
the ghost of Bogandoran thought it prudent to give up the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time, filled no doubt with great indignation at
this signal defeat, it seems the ghost resolved to re-engage my grand-uncle
on some other occasion, under more favourable circumstances.&nbsp; Not
long after, as my grand-uncle was returning home quite unattended from
another ball in the Braes of the country, he had just entered the hollow
of Auldichoish, well known for its &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; properties, when,
lo! who presented himself to his view on the adjacent eminence but his
old friend of Bogandoran, advancing as large as the gable of a house,
and putting himself in the most threatening and fighting attitudes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking at the very dangerous nature of the ground where they
had met, and feeling no anxiety <!-- page 91--><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>for
a second encounter with a combatant of his weight, in a situation so
little desirable, the fiddler would have willingly deferred the settlement
of their differences till a more convenient season.&nbsp; He, accordingly,
assuming the most submissive aspect in the world, endeavoured to pass
by his champion in peace, but in vain.&nbsp; Longing, no doubt, to retrieve
the disgrace of his late discomfiture, the bogle instantly seized the
fiddler, and attempted with all his might to pull the latter down the
precipice, with the diabolical intention, it is supposed, of drowning
him in the river Avon below.&nbsp; In this pious design the bogle was
happily frustrated by the intervention of some trees which grew on the
precipice, and to which my unhappy grand-uncle clung with the zeal of
a drowning man.&nbsp; The enraged ghost, finding it impossible to extricate
him from those friendly trees, and resolving, at all events, to be revenged
upon him, fell upon maltreating the fiddler with his hands and feet
in the most inhuman manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such gross indignities my worthy grand-uncle was not accustomed
to, and being incensed beyond all measure at the liberties taken by
Bogandoran, he resolved again to try his mettle, whether life or death
should be the consequence.&nbsp; Having no other weapon wherewith to
defend himself but his <i>biodag</i>, which, considering the nature
of his opponent&rsquo;s constitution, he suspected much would be of
little <!-- page 92--><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>avail to him&mdash;I
say, in the absence of any other weapon, he sheathed the <i>biodag</i>
three times in the ghost of Bogandoran&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; And what
was the consequence?&nbsp; Why, to the great astonishment of my courageous
forefather, the ghost fell down cold dead at his feet, and was never
more seen or heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 93--><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>THOMAS THE RHYMER.</h2>
<p>Thomas, of Ercildoun, in Lauderdale, called the Rhymer, on account
of his producing a poetical romance on the subject of Tristrem and Yseult,
which is curious as the earliest specimen of English verse known to
exist, flourished in the reign of Alexander III. of Scotland.&nbsp;
Like other men of talent of the period, Thomas was suspected of magic.&nbsp;
He was also said to have the gift of prophecy, which was accounted for
in the following peculiar manner, referring entirely to the Elfin superstition.</p>
<p>As Thomas lay on Huntly Bank (a place on the descent of the Eildon
Hills, which raise their triple crest above the celebrated monastery
of Melrose), he saw a lady so extremely beautiful that he imagined she
must be the Virgin Mary herself.&nbsp; Her appointments, however, were
those rather of an amazon, or goddess of the woods.&nbsp; Her steed
was of the highest beauty, and at its mane hung thirty silver bells
and nine, which were music to the wind <!-- page 94--><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>as
she paced along.&nbsp; Her saddle was of &ldquo;royal bone&rdquo; (ivory),
laid over with &ldquo;orfeverie&rdquo; (goldsmith&rsquo;s work).&nbsp;
Her stirrups, her dress, all corresponded with her extreme beauty and
the magnificence of her array.&nbsp; The fair huntress had her bow in
hand, and her arrows at her belt.&nbsp; She led three greyhounds in
a leash, and three raches, or hounds of scent, followed her closely.</p>
<p>She rejected and disclaimed the homage which Thomas desired to pay
her; so that, passing from one extremity to the other, Thomas became
as bold as he had at first been humble.&nbsp; The lady warned him he
must become her slave if he wished to prosecute his suit.&nbsp; Before
their interview terminated, the appearance of the beautiful lady was
changed into that of the most hideous hag in existence.&nbsp; A witch
from the spital or almshouse would have been a goddess in comparison
to the late beautiful huntress.&nbsp; Hideous as she was, Thomas felt
that he had placed himself in the power of this hag, and when she bade
him take leave of the sun, and of the leaf that grew on the tree, he
felt himself under the necessity of obeying her.&nbsp; A cavern received
them, in which, following his frightful guide, he for three days travelled
in darkness, sometimes hearing the booming of a distant ocean, sometimes
walking through rivers of blood, which crossed their subterranean path.&nbsp;
At length they emerged into daylight, in a most beautiful orchard.&nbsp;
Thomas, almost <!-- page 95--><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>fainting
for want of food, stretched out his hand towards the goodly fruit which
hung around him, but was forbidden by his conductress, who informed
him that these were the fatal apples which were the cause of the fall
of man.&nbsp; He perceived also that his guide had no sooner entered
this mysterious ground and breathed its magic air than she was revived
in beauty, equipage, and splendour, as fair or fairer than he had first
seen her on the mountain.&nbsp; She then proceeded to explain to him
the character of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder right-hand path,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;conveys the
spirits of the blest to paradise.&nbsp; Yon downward and well-worn way
leads sinful souls to the place of everlasting punishment.&nbsp; The
third road, by yonder dark brake, conducts to the milder place of pain,
from which prayer and mass may release offenders.&nbsp; But see you
yet a fourth road, sweeping along the plain to yonder splendid castle?&nbsp;
Yonder is the road to Elfland, to which we are now bound.&nbsp; The
lord of the castle is king of the country, and I am his queen; and when
we enter yonder castle, you must observe strict silence, and answer
no question that is asked you, and I will account for your silence by
saying I took your speech when I brought you from middle earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus instructed him, they journeyed on to the castle, and,
entering by the kitchen, found themselves in the midst of such a festive
scene as <!-- page 96--><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>might become
the mansion of a great feudal lord or prince.</p>
<p>Thirty carcasses of deer were lying on the massive kitchen board,
under the hands of numerous cooks, who toiled to cut them up and dress
them, while the gigantic greyhounds which had taken the spoil lay lapping
the blood, and enjoying the sight of the slain game.&nbsp; They came
next to the royal hall, where the king received his loving consort;
knights and ladies, dancing by threes, occupied the floor of the hall;
and Thomas, the fatigue of his journey from the Eildon Hills forgotten,
went forward and joined in the revelry.&nbsp; After a period, however,
which seemed to him a very short one, the queen spoke with him apart,
and bade him prepare to return to his own country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;how long think you that
you have been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certes, fair lady,&rdquo; answered Thomas, &ldquo;not above
these seven days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are deceived,&rdquo; answered the queen; &ldquo;you have
been seven years in this castle, and it is full time you were gone.&nbsp;
Know, Thomas, that the archfiend will come to this castle to-morrow
to demand his tribute, and so handsome a man as you will attract his
eye.&nbsp; For all the world would I not suffer you to be betrayed to
such a fate; therefore up, and let us be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This terrible news reconciled Thomas to his departure <!-- page 97--><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>from
Elfinland; and the queen was not long in placing him upon Huntly Bank,
where the birds were singing.&nbsp; She took leave of him, and to ensure
his reputation bestowed on him the tongue which <i>could not lie</i>.&nbsp;
Thomas in vain objected to this inconvenient and involuntary adhesion
to veracity, which would make him, as he thought, unfit for church or
for market, for king&rsquo;s court or for lady&rsquo;s bower.&nbsp;
But all his remonstrances were disregarded by the lady; and Thomas the
Rhymer, whenever the discourse turned on the future, gained the credit
of a prophet whether he would or not, for he could say nothing but what
was sure to come to pass.</p>
<p>Thomas remained several years in his own tower near Ercildoun, and
enjoyed the fame of his predictions, several of which are current among
the country people to this day.&nbsp; At length, as the prophet was
entertaining the Earl of March in his dwelling, a cry of astonishment
arose in the village, on the appearance of a hart and hind, which left
the forest, and, contrary to their shy nature, came quietly onward,
traversing the village towards the dwelling of Thomas.&nbsp; The prophet
instantly rose from the board, and acknowledging the prodigy as the
summons of his fate, he accompanied the hart and hind into the forest,
and though occasionally seen by individuals to whom he has chosen to
show himself, he has never again mixed familiarly with mankind.</p>
<h2><!-- page 98--><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>FAIRY FRIENDS.</h2>
<p>It is a good thing to befriend the fairies, as the following stories
show:&mdash;</p>
<p>There have been from time immemorial at Hawick, during the two or
three last weeks of the year, markets once a week, for the disposal
of sheep for slaughter, at which the greater number of people, both
in the middle and poorer classes of life, have been accustomed to provide
themselves with their <i>marts</i>.&nbsp; A poor man from Jedburgh who
was on his way to Hawick for the purpose of attending one of these markets,
as he was passing over that side of Rubislaw which is nearest the Teviot,
was suddenly alarmed by a frightful and unaccountable noise.&nbsp; The
sound, as he supposed, proceeded from an immense number of female voices,
but no objects whence it could come were visible.&nbsp; Amidst howling
and wailing were mixed shouts of mirth and jollity, but he could gather
nothing articulate except the following words&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O there&rsquo;s a bairn born, but there&rsquo;s naething to
pit on &rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 99--><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>The occasion of
this elfish concert, it seemed, was the birth of a fairy child, at which
the fairies, with the exception of two or three who were discomposed
at having nothing to cover the little innocent with, were enjoying themselves
with that joviality usually characteristic of such an event.&nbsp; The
astonished rustic finding himself amongst a host of invisible beings,
in a wild moorland place, and far from any human assistance, should
assistance be required, full of the greatest consternation, immediately
on hearing this expression again and again vociferated, stripped off
his plaid, and threw it on the ground.&nbsp; It was instantly snatched
up by an invisible hand, and the wailings immediately ceased, but the
shouts of mirth were continued with increased vigour.&nbsp; Being of
opinion that what he had done had satisfied his invisible friends, he
lost no time in making off, and proceeded on his road to Hawick, musing
on his singular adventure.&nbsp; He purchased a sheep, which turned
out a remarkably good bargain, and returned to Jedburgh.&nbsp; He had
no cause to regret his generosity in bestowing his plaid on the fairies,
for every day afterwards his wealth multiplied, and he continued till
the day of his death a rich and prosperous man.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>About the beginning of harvest, there having been a want of meal
for <i>shearers</i>&rsquo; bread in the farmhouse of Bedrule, a small
quantity of barley (being all <!-- page 100--><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>that
was yet ripe) was cut down, and converted into meal.&nbsp; Mrs. Buckham,
the farmer&rsquo;s wife, rose early in the morning to bake the bread,
and, while she was engaged in baking, a little woman in green costume
came in, and, with much politeness, asked for a loan of a capful of
meal.&nbsp; Mrs. Buckham thought it prudent to comply with her request.&nbsp;
In a short time afterwards the woman in green returned with an equal
quantity of meal, which Mrs. Buckham put into the <i>meal-ark</i>.&nbsp;
This meal had such a lasting quality, that from it alone the gudewife
of Bedrule baked as much bread as served her own family and the reapers
throughout the harvest, and when harvest was over it was not exhausted.</p>
<h2><!-- page 101--><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>THE SEAL-CATCHER&rsquo;S
ADVENTURE.</h2>
<p>There was once upon a time a man who lived upon the northern coasts,
not far from &ldquo;Taigh Jan Crot Callow&rdquo; (John-o&rsquo;-Groat&rsquo;s
House), and he gained his livelihood by catching and killing fish, of
all sizes and denominations.&nbsp; He had a particular liking for the
killing of those wonderful beasts, half dog half fish, called &ldquo;Roane,&rdquo;
or seals, no doubt because he got a long price for their skins, which
are not less curious than they are valuable.&nbsp; The truth is, that
the most of these animals are neither dogs nor cods, but downright fairies,
as this narration will show; and, indeed, it is easy for any man to
convince himself of the fact by a simple examination of his <i>tobacco-spluichdan</i>,
for the dead skins of those beings are never the same for four-and-twenty
hours together.&nbsp; Sometimes the <i>spluichdan</i> will erect its
bristles almost perpendicularly, while, at other times, it reclines
them even down; one time it resembles a bristly sow, at another time
a <i>sleekit cat</i>; and what dead skin, except itself, could perform
such cantrips?&nbsp; Now, it happened one day, as this <!-- page 102--><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>notable
fisher had returned from the prosecution of his calling, that he was
called upon by a man who seemed a great stranger, and who said he had
been despatched for him by a person who wished to contract for a quantity
of seal-skins, and that the fisher must accompany him (the stranger)
immediately to see the person who wished to contract for the skins,
as it was necessary that he should be served that evening.&nbsp; Happy
in the prospect of making a good bargain, and never suspecting any duplicity,
he instantly complied.&nbsp; They both mounted a steed belonging to
the stranger, and took the road with such velocity that, although the
direction of the wind was towards their backs, yet the fleetness of
their movement made it appear as if it had been in their faces.&nbsp;
On reaching a stupendous precipice which overhung the sea, his guide
told him they had now reached their destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the person you spoke of!&rdquo; inquired the astonished
seal-killer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see that presently,&rdquo; replied the guide.&nbsp;
With that they immediately alighted, and, without allowing the seal-killer
much time to indulge the frightful suspicions that began to pervade
his mind, the stranger seized him with irresistible force, and plunged
headlong with him into the sea.&nbsp; After sinking down, down, nobody
knows how far, they at length reached a door, which, being open, led
them into a range of apartments, filled with inhabitants&mdash;not <!-- page 103--><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>people,
but seals, who could nevertheless speak and feel like human folk; and
how much was the seal-killer surprised to find that he himself had been
unconsciously transformed into the like image.&nbsp; If it were not
so, he would probably have died from the want of breath.&nbsp; The nature
of the poor fisher&rsquo;s thoughts may be more easily conceived than
described.&nbsp; Looking at the nature of the quarters into which he
had landed, all hopes of escape from them appeared wholly chimerical,
whilst the degree of comfort, and length of life which the barren scene
promised him were far from being flattering.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Roane,&rdquo;
who all seemed in very low spirits, appeared to feel for him, and endeavoured
to soothe the distress which he evinced by the amplest assurances of
personal safety.&nbsp; Involved in sad meditation on his evil fate,
he was quickly roused from his stupor by his guide&rsquo;s producing
a huge gully or joctaleg, the object of which he supposed was to put
an end to all his earthly cares.&nbsp; Forlorn as was his situation,
however, he did not wish to be killed; and, apprehending instant destruction,
he fell down, and earnestly implored for mercy.&nbsp; The poor generous
animals did not mean him any harm, however much his former conduct deserved
it, and he was accordingly desired to pacify himself, and cease his
cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see that knife before?&rdquo; said the stranger
to the fisher.</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>The latter instantly
recognised his own knife, which he had that day stuck into a seal, and
with which it had escaped, and acknowledged it was formerly his own,
for what would be the use of denying it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined the guide, &ldquo;the apparent seal
which made away with it is my father, who has lain dangerously ill ever
since, and no means can stay his fleeting breath without your aid.&nbsp;
I have been obliged to resort to the artifice I have practised to bring
you hither, and I trust that my filial duty to my father will readily
excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, he led into another apartment the trembling seal-killer,
who expected every minute to be punished for his own ill-treatment of
the father.&nbsp; There he found the identical seal with which he had
had the encounter in the morning, suffering most grievously from a tremendous
cut in its hind-quarter.&nbsp; The seal-killer was then desired, with
his hand, to cicatrise the wound, upon doing which it immediately healed,
and the seal arose from its bed in perfect health.&nbsp; Upon this the
scene changed from mourning to rejoicing&mdash;all was mirth and glee.&nbsp;
Very different, however, were the feelings of the unfortunate seal-catcher,
who expected no doubt to be metamorphosed into a seal for the remainder
of his life.&nbsp; However, his late guide accosting him, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, you are at liberty to return to your <!-- page 105--><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>wife
and family, to whom I am about to conduct you; but it is on this express
condition, to which you must bind yourself by a solemn oath, viz. that
you will never maim or kill a seal in all your lifetime hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this condition, hard as it was, he joyfully acceded; and the oath
being administered in all due form, he bade his new acquaintance most
heartily and sincerely a long farewell.&nbsp; Taking hold of his guide,
they issued from the place and swam up, till they regained the surface
of the sea, and, landing at the said stupendous pinnacle, they found
their former steed ready for a second canter.&nbsp; The guide breathed
upon the fisher, and they became like men.&nbsp; They mounted their
horse, and fleet as had been their course towards the precipice, their
return from it was doubly swift; and the honest seal-killer was laid
down at his own door-cheek, where his guide made him such a present
as would have almost reconciled him to another similar expedition, such
as rendered his loss of profession, in so far as regarded the seals,
a far less intolerable hardship than he had at first considered it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 106--><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>THE FAIRIES OF
MERLIN&rsquo;S CRAIG.</h2>
<p>Early in the seventeenth century, John Smith, a barn-man at a farm,
was sent by his master to cast divots (turf) on the green immediately
behind Merlin&rsquo;s Craig.&nbsp; After having laboured for a considerable
time, there came round from the front of the rock a little woman, about
eighteen inches in height, clad in a green gown and red stockings, with
long yellow hair hanging down to her waist, who asked the astonished
operator how he would feel were she to send her husband to <i>tir</i>
(uncover) his house, at the same time commanding him to place every
<i>divot</i> he had cast <i>in statu quo</i>.&nbsp; John obeyed with
fear and trembling, and, returning to his master, told what had happened.&nbsp;
The farmer laughed at his credulity, and, anxious to cure him of such
idle superstition, ordered him to take a cart and fetch home the <i>divots</i>
immediately.</p>
<p>John obeyed, although with much reluctance.&nbsp; Nothing happened
to him in consequence till that day twelve months, when he left his
master&rsquo;s work at the usual hour in the evening, with a small <i>stoup</i>
<!-- page 107--><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>of milk in his hand,
but he did not reach home, nor was he ever heard of for years (I have
forgotten how many), when, upon the anniversary of that unfortunate
day, John walked into his house at the usual hour, with the milk-stoup
in his hand.</p>
<p>The account that he gave of his captivity was that, on the evening
of that eventful day, returning home from his labour, when passing Merlin&rsquo;s
Craig, he felt himself suddenly taken ill, and sat down to rest a little.&nbsp;
Soon after he fell asleep, and awoke, as he supposed, about midnight,
when there was a troop of male and female fairies dancing round him.&nbsp;
They insisted upon his joining in the sport, and gave him the finest
girl in the company as a partner.&nbsp; She took him by the hand; they
danced three times round in a fairy ring, after which he became so happy
that he felt no inclination to leave his new associates.&nbsp; Their
amusements were protracted till he heard his master&rsquo;s cock crow,
when the whole troop immediately rushed forward to the front of the
craig, hurrying him along with them.&nbsp; A door opened to receive
them, and he continued a prisoner until the evening on which he returned,
when the same woman who had first appeared to him when casting <i>divots</i>
came and told him that the grass was again green on the roof of her
house, which he had <i>tirred</i>, and if he would swear an oath, which
she dictated, never to discover what he had seen in fairyland, he should
be at liberty to return to his family.&nbsp; <!-- page 108--><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>John
took the oath, and observed it most religiously, although sadly teased
and questioned by his helpmate, particularly about the &ldquo;bonnie
lassie&rdquo; with whom he danced on the night of his departure.&nbsp;
He was also observed to walk a mile out of his way rather than pass
Merlin&rsquo;s Craig when the sun was below the horizon.</p>
<p>On a subsequent occasion the tiny inhabitants of Merlin&rsquo;s Craig
surprised a shepherd when watching his fold at night; he was asleep,
and his bonnet had fallen off and rolled to some little distance.&nbsp;
He was awakened by the fairies dancing round him in a circle, and was
induced to join them; but recollecting the fate of John Smith, he would
not allow his female companion to take hold of his hands.&nbsp; In the
midst of their gambols they came close to the hillock where the shepherd&rsquo;s
bonnet lay,&mdash;he affected to stumble, fell upon his bonnet, which
he immediately seized, clapping it on his head, when the whole troop
instantly vanished.&nbsp; This exorcism was produced by the talismanic
power of a Catechism containing the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the Apostles&rsquo;
Creed, which the shepherd most fortunately recollected was deposited
in the crown of his bonnet.</p>
<h2><!-- page 109--><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>RORY MACGILLIVRAY.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time a tenant in the neighbourhood of Cairngorm, in Strathspey,
emigrated with his family and cattle to the forest of Glenavon, which
is well known to be inhabited by many fairies as well as ghosts.&nbsp;
Two of his sons being out late one night in search of some of their
sheep which had strayed, had occasion to pass a fairy turret, or dwelling,
of very large dimensions; and what was their astonishment on observing
streams of the most refulgent light shining forth through innumerable
crevices in the rock&mdash;crevices which the sharpest eye in the country
had never seen before.&nbsp; Curiosity led them towards the turret,
when they were charmed by the most exquisite sounds ever emitted by
a fiddle-string, which, joined to the sportive mirth and glee accompanying
it, reconciled them in a great measure to the scene, although they knew
well enough the inhabitants of the nook were fairies.&nbsp; Nay, overpowered
by the enchanting jigs played by the fiddler, one of the brothers had
even the hardihood to propose that they should pay the occupants of
the <!-- page 110--><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>turret a short
visit.&nbsp; To this motion the other brother, fond as he was of dancing,
and animated as he was by the music, would by no means consent, and
he earnestly desired his brother to restrain his curiosity.&nbsp; But
every new jig that was played, and every new reel that was danced, inspired
the adventurous brother with additional ardour, and at length, completely
fascinated by the enchanting revelry, leaving all prudence behind, at
one leap he entered the &ldquo;Shian.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor forlorn
brother was now left in a most uncomfortable situation.&nbsp; His grief
for the loss of a brother whom he dearly loved suggested to him more
than once the desperate idea of sharing his fate by following his example.&nbsp;
But, on the other hand, when he coolly considered the possibility of
sharing very different entertainment from that which rang upon his ears,
and remembered, too, the comforts and convenience of his father&rsquo;s
fireside, the idea immediately appeared to him anything but prudent.&nbsp;
After a long and disagreeable altercation between his affection for
his brother and his regard for himself, he came to the resolution to
take a middle course, that is, to shout in at the window a few remonstrances
to his brother, which, if he did not attend to, let the consequences
be upon his own head.&nbsp; Accordingly, taking his station at one of
the crevices, and calling upon his brother three several times by name,
as use is, he uttered the most moving pieces of elocution he could <!-- page 111--><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>think
of, imploring him, as he valued his poor parents&rsquo; life and blessing,
to come forth and go home with him, Donald Macgillivray, his thrice
affectionate and unhappy brother.&nbsp; But whether it was the dancer
could not hear this eloquent harangue, or, what is more probable, that
he did not choose to attend to it, certain it is that it proved totally
ineffectual to accomplish its object, and the consequence was that Donald
Macgillivray found it equally his duty and his interest to return home
to his family with the melancholy tale of poor Rory&rsquo;s fate.&nbsp;
All the prescribed ceremonies calculated to rescue him from the fairy
dominion were resorted to by his mourning relatives without effect,
and Rory was supposed lost for ever, when a &ldquo;wise man&rdquo; of
the day having learned the circumstance, discovered to his friends a
plan by which they might deliver him at the end of twelve months from
his entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return,&rdquo; says the <i>Duin Glichd</i> to Donald, &ldquo;to
the place where you lost your brother a year and a day from the time.&nbsp;
You will insert in your garment a <i>Rowan Cross</i>, which will protect
you from the fairies&rsquo; interposition.&nbsp; Enter the turret boldly
and resolutely in the name of the Highest, claim your brother, and,
if he does not accompany you voluntarily, seize him and carry him off
by force&mdash;none dare interfere with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The experiment appeared to the cautious contemplative <!-- page 112--><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>brother
as one that was fraught with no ordinary danger, and he would have most
willingly declined the prominent character allotted to him in the performance
but for the importunate entreaty of his friends, who implored him, as
he valued their blessing, not to slight such excellent advice.&nbsp;
Their entreaties, together with his confidence in the virtues of the
<i>Rowan Cross</i>, overcame his scruples, and he at length agreed to
put the experiment in practice, whatever the result might be.</p>
<p>Well, then, the important day arrived, when the father of the two
sons was destined either to recover his lost son, or to lose the only
son he had, and, anxious as the father felt, Donald Macgillivray, the
intended adventurer, felt no less so on the occasion.&nbsp; The hour
of midnight approached when the drama was to be acted, and Donald Macgillivray,
loaded with all the charms and benedictions in his country, took mournful
leave of his friends, and proceeded to the scene of his intended enterprise.&nbsp;
On approaching the well-known turret, a repetition of that mirth and
those ravishing sounds, that had been the source of so much sorrow to
himself and family, once more attracted his attention, without at all
creating in his mind any extraordinary feelings of satisfaction.&nbsp;
On the contrary, he abhorred the sounds most heartily, and felt much
greater inclination to recede than to advance.&nbsp; But what was to
be done?&nbsp; Courage, character, and everything dear <!-- page 113--><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>to
him were at stake, so that to advance was his only alternative.&nbsp;
In short, he reached the &ldquo;Shian,&rdquo; and, after twenty fruitless
attempts, he at length entered the place with trembling footsteps, and
amidst the brilliant and jovial scene the not least gratifying spectacle
which presented itself to Donald was his brother Rory earnestly engaged
at the Highland fling on the floor, at which, as might have been expected,
he had greatly improved.&nbsp; Without losing much time in satisfying
his curiosity by examining the quality of the company, Donald ran to
his brother, repeating, most vehemently, the words prescribed to him
by the &ldquo;wise man,&rdquo; seized him by the collar, and insisted
on his immediately accompanying him home to his poor afflicted parents.&nbsp;
Rory assented, provided he would allow him to finish his single reel,
assuring Donald, very earnestly, that he had not been half an hour in
the house.&nbsp; In vain did the latter assure him that, instead of
half an hour, he had actually remained twelve months.&nbsp; Nor would
he have believed his overjoyed friends when his brother at length got
him home, did not the calves, now grown into stots, and the new-born
babes, now travelling the house, at length convince him that in his
single reel he had danced for a twelvemonth and a day.</p>

<p>Along the sea of Solway, romantic on the Scottish side, with its
woodland, its bays, its cliffs, and headlands; and interesting on the
English side, with its many beautiful towns with their shadows on the
water, rich pastures, safe harbours, and numerous ships, there still
linger many traditional stories of a maritime nature, most of them connected
with superstitions singularly wild and unusual.&nbsp; To the curious
these tales afford a rich fund of entertainment, from the many diversities
of the same story; some dry and barren, and stripped of all the embellishments
of poetry; others dressed out in all the <!-- page 115--><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>riches
of a superstitious belief and haunted imagination.&nbsp; In this they
resemble the inland traditions of the peasants; but many of the oral
treasures of the Galwegian or the Cumbrian coast have the stamp of the
Dane and the Norseman upon them, and claim but a remote or faint affinity
with the legitimate legends of Caledonia.&nbsp; Something like a rude
prosaic outline of several of the most noted of the northern ballads,
the adventures and depredations of the old ocean kings, still lends
life to the evening tale; and, among others, the story of the Haunted
Ships is still popular among the maritime peasantry.</p>
<p>One fine harvest evening I went on board the shallop of Richard Faulder,
of Allanbay, and, committing ourselves to the waters, we allowed a gentle
wind from the east to waft us at its pleasure towards the Scottish coast.&nbsp;
We passed the sharp promontory of Siddick, and, skirting the land within
a stonecast, glided along the shore till we came within sight of the
ruined Abbey of Sweetheart.&nbsp; The green mountain of Criffel ascended
beside us; and the bleat of the flocks from its summit, together with
the winding of the evening horn of the reapers, came softened into something
like music over land and sea.&nbsp; We pushed our shallop into a deep
and wooded bay, and sat silently looking on the serene beauty of the
place.&nbsp; The moon glimmered in her rising through the tall <!-- page 116--><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>shafts
of the pines of Caerlaverock; and the sky, with scarce a cloud, showered
down on wood and headland and bay the twinkling beams of a thousand
stars, rendering every object visible.&nbsp; The tide, too, was coming
with that swift and silent swell observable when the wind is gentle;
the woody curves along the land were filling with the flood, till it
touched the green branches of the drooping trees; while in the centre
current the roll and the plunge of a thousand pellocks told to the experienced
fisherman that salmon were abundant.</p>
<p>As we looked, we saw an old man emerging from a path that wound to
the shore through a grove of doddered hazel; he carried a halve-net
on his back, while behind him came a girl, bearing a small harpoon,
with which the fishers are remarkably dexterous in striking their prey.&nbsp;
The senior seated himself on a large grey stone, which overlooked the
bay, laid aside his bonnet, and submitted his bosom and neck to the
refreshing sea breeze, and, taking his harpoon from his attendant, sat
with the gravity and composure of a spirit of the flood, with his ministering
nymph behind him.&nbsp; We pushed our shallop to the shore, and soon
stood at their side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is old Mark Macmoran the mariner, with his granddaughter
Barbara,&rdquo; said Richard Faulder, in a whisper that had something
of fear in it; &ldquo;he knows every creek and cavern and quicksand
in Solway; has seen the Spectre Hound that haunts <!-- page 117--><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>the
Isle of Man; has heard him bark, and at every bark has seen a ship sink;
and he has seen, too, the Haunted Ships in full sail; and, if all tales
be true, he has sailed in them himself;&mdash;he&rsquo;s an awful person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though I perceived in the communication of my friend something of
the superstition of the sailor, I could not help thinking that common
rumour had made a happy choice in singling out old Mark to maintain
her intercourse with the invisible world.&nbsp; His hair, which seemed
to have refused all intercourse with the comb, hung matted upon his
shoulders; a kind of mantle, or rather blanket, pinned with a wooden
skewer round his neck, fell mid-leg down, concealing all his nether
garments as far as a pair of hose, darned with yarn of all conceivable
colours, and a pair of shoes, patched and repaired till nothing of the
original structure remained, and clasped on his feet with two massy
silver buckles.&nbsp; If the dress of the old man was rude and sordid,
that of his granddaughter was gay, and even rich.&nbsp; She wore a bodice
of fine wool, wrought round the bosom with alternate leaf and lily,
and a kirtle of the same fabric, which, almost touching her white and
delicate ankle, showed her snowy feet, so fairy-light and round that
they scarcely seemed to touch the grass where she stood.&nbsp; Her hair,
a natural ornament which woman seeks much to improve, was of bright
glossy brown, and encumbered rather than <!-- page 118--><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>adorned
with a snood, set thick with marine productions, among which the small
clear pearl found in the Solway was conspicuous.&nbsp; Nature had not
trusted to a handsome shape and a sylph-like air for young Barbara&rsquo;s
influence over the heart of man, but had bestowed a pair of large bright
blue eyes, swimming in liquid light, so full of love and gentleness
and joy, that all the sailors from Annanwater to far Saint Bees acknowledged
their power, and sang songs about the bonnie lass of Mark Macmoran.&nbsp;
She stood holding a small gaff-hook of polished steel in her hand, and
seemed not dissatisfied with the glances I bestowed on her from time
to time, and which I held more than requited by a single glance of those
eyes which retained so many capricious hearts in subjection.</p>
<p>The tide, though rapidly augmenting, had not yet filled the bay at
our feet.&nbsp; The moon now streamed fairly over the tops of Caerlaverock
pines, and showed the expanse of ocean dimpling and swelling, on which
sloops and shallops came dancing, and displaying at every turn their
extent of white sail against the beam of the moon.&nbsp; I looked on
old Mark the mariner, who, seated motionless on his grey stone, kept
his eye fixed on the increasing waters with a look of seriousness and
sorrow, in which I saw little of the calculating spirit of a mere fisherman.&nbsp;
Though he looked on the coming tide, his eyes seemed to dwell particularly
on the black <!-- page 119--><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>and
decayed hulls of two vessels, which, half immersed in the quicksand,
still addressed to every heart a tale of shipwreck and desolation.&nbsp;
The tide wheeled and foamed around them, and, creeping inch by inch
up the side, at last fairly threw its waters over the top, and a long
and hollow eddy showed the resistance which the liquid element received.</p>
<p>The moment they were fairly buried in the water, the old man clasped
his hands together, and said: &ldquo;Blessed be the tide that will break
over and bury ye for ever!&nbsp; Sad to mariners, and sorrowful to maids
and mothers, has the time been you have choked up this deep and bonnie
bay.&nbsp; For evil were you sent, and for evil have you continued.&nbsp;
Every season finds from you its song of sorrow and wail, its funeral
processions, and its shrouded corses.&nbsp; Woe to the land where the
wood grew that made ye!&nbsp; Cursed be the axe that hewed ye on the
mountains, the hands that joined ye together, the bay that ye first
swam in, and the wind that wafted ye here!&nbsp; Seven times have ye
put my life in peril, three fair sons have ye swept from my side, and
two bonnie grand-bairns; and now, even now, your waters foam and flash
for my destruction, did I venture my infirm limbs in quest of food in
your deadly bay.&nbsp; I see by that ripple and that foam, and hear
by the sound and singing of your surge, that ye yearn for another victim;
but it shall not be me nor mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Even as the old
mariner addressed himself to the wrecked ships, a young man appeared
at the southern extremity of the bay, holding his halve-net in his hand,
and hastening into the current.&nbsp; Mark rose and shouted, and waved
him back from a place which, to a person unacquainted with the dangers
of the bay, real and superstitious, seemed sufficiently perilous; his
granddaughter, too, added her voice to his, and waved her white hands;
but the more they strove, the faster advanced the peasant, till he stood
to his middle in the water, while the tide increased every moment in
depth and strength.&nbsp; &ldquo;Andrew, Andrew,&rdquo; cried the young
woman, in a voice quavering with emotion, &ldquo;turn, turn, I tell
you!&nbsp; O the Ships, the Haunted Ships!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the appearance
of a fine run of fish had more influence with the peasant than the voice
of bonnie Barbara, and forward he dashed, net in hand.&nbsp; In a moment
he was borne off his feet, and mingled like foam with the water, and
hurried towards the fatal eddies which whirled and roared round the
sunken ships.&nbsp; But he was a powerful young man, and an expert swimmer;
he seized on one of the projecting ribs of the nearest hulk, and clinging
to it with the grasp of despair, uttered yell after yell, sustaining
himself against the prodigious rush of the current.</p>
<p>From a shealing of turf and straw, within the pitch of a bar from
the spot where we stood, came out an old woman bent with age, and leaning
on a <!-- page 121--><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>crutch.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I heard the voice of that lad Andrew Lammie; can the chield be
drowning that he skirls sae uncannily?&rdquo; said the old woman, seating
herself on the ground, and looking earnestly at the water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ou,
ay,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s doomed, he&rsquo;s doomed;
heart and hand can never save him; boats, ropes, and man&rsquo;s strength
and wit, all vain! vain!&mdash;he&rsquo;s doomed, he&rsquo;s doomed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time I had thrown myself into the shallop, followed reluctantly
by Richard Faulder, over whose courage and kindness of heart superstition
had great power, and with one push from the shore, and some exertion
in sculling, we came within a quoitcast of the unfortunate fisherman.&nbsp;
He stayed not to profit by our aid; for, when he perceived us near,
he uttered a piercing shriek of joy, and bounded towards us through
the agitated element the full length of an oar.&nbsp; I saw him for
a second on the surface of the water, but the eddying current sucked
him down; and all I ever beheld of him again was his hand held above
the flood, and clutching in agony at some imaginary aid.&nbsp; I sat
gazing in horror on the vacant sea before us; but a breathing-time before,
a human being, full of youth and strength and hope, was there; his cries
were still ringing in my ears, and echoing in the woods; and now nothing
was seen or heard save the turbulent expanse of water, and the sound
of its chafing on the shores.&nbsp; We pushed back our shallop, <!-- page 122--><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>and
resumed our station on the cliff beside the old mariner and his descendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore sought ye to peril your own lives fruitlessly,&rdquo;
said Mark, &ldquo;in attempting to save the doomed?&nbsp; Whoso touches
those infernal ships never survives to tell the tale.&nbsp; Woe to the
man who is found nigh them at midnight when the tide has subsided, and
they arise in their former beauty, with forecastle, and deck, and sail,
and pennon, and shroud!&nbsp; Then is seen the streaming of lights along
the water from their cabin windows, and then is heard the sound of mirth
and the clamour of tongues, and the infernal whoop and halloo and song,
ringing far and wide.&nbsp; Woe to the man who comes nigh them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all this my Allanbay companion listened with a breathless attention.&nbsp;
I felt something touched with a superstition to which I partly believed
I had seen one victim offered up; and I inquired of the old mariner,
&ldquo;How and when came these Haunted Ships there?&nbsp; To me they
seem but the melancholy relics of some unhappy voyagers, and much more
likely to warn people to shun destruction than entice and delude them
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said the old man with a smile, which had more
of sorrow in it than of mirth; &ldquo;and so, young man, these black
and shattered hulks seem to the eye of the multitude.&nbsp; But things
are not what they seem: that water, a kind and convenient <!-- page 123--><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>servant
to the wants of man, which seems so smooth and so dimpling and so gentle,
has swallowed up a human soul even now; and the place which it covers,
so fair and so level, is a faithless quicksand, out of which none escape.&nbsp;
Things are otherwise than they seem.&nbsp; Had you lived as long as
I have had the sorrow to live; had you seen the storms, and braved the
perils, and endured the distresses which have befallen me; had you sat
gazing out on the dreary ocean at midnight on a haunted coast; had you
seen comrade after comrade, brother after brother, and son after son,
swept away by the merciless ocean from your very side; had you seen
the shapes of friends, doomed to the wave and the quicksand, appearing
to you in the dreams and visions of the night, then would your mind
have been prepared for crediting the maritime legends of mariners; and
the two haunted Danish ships would have had their terrors for you, as
they have for all who sojourn on this coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the time and the cause of their destruction,&rdquo; continued
the old man, &ldquo;I know nothing certain; they have stood as you have
seen them for uncounted time; and while all other ships wrecked on this
unhappy coast have gone to pieces, and rotted and sunk away in a few
years, these two haunted hulks have neither sunk in the quicksand, nor
has a single spar or board been displaced.&nbsp; Maritime legend says
that two ships of Denmark <!-- page 124--><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>having
had permission, for a time, to work deeds of darkness and dolor on the
deep, were at last condemned to the whirlpool and the sunken rock, and
were wrecked in this bonnie bay, as a sign to seamen to be gentle and
devout.&nbsp; The night when they were lost was a harvest evening of
uncommon mildness and beauty: the sun had newly set; the moon came brighter
and brighter out; and the reapers, laying their sickles at the root
of the standing corn, stood on rock and bank, looking at the increasing
magnitude of the waters, for sea and land were visible from Saint Bees
to Barnhourie.&nbsp; The sails of two vessels were soon seen bent for
the Scottish coast; and, with a speed outrunning the swiftest ship,
they approached the dangerous quicksands and headland of Borranpoint.&nbsp;
On the deck of the foremost ship not a living soul was seen, or shape,
unless something in darkness and form, resembling a human shadow could
be called a shape, which flitted from extremity to extremity of the
ship, with the appearance of trimming the sails, and directing the vessel&rsquo;s
course.&nbsp; But the decks of its companion were crowded with human
shapes; the captain and mate, and sailor and cabin-boy, all seemed there;
and from them the sound of mirth and minstrelsy echoed over land and
water.&nbsp; The coast which they skirted along was one of extreme danger,
and the reapers shouted to warn them to beware of sandbank and rock;
but of this friendly counsel no <!-- page 125--><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>notice
was taken, except that a large and famished dog, which sat on the prow,
answered every shout with a long, loud, and melancholy howl.&nbsp; The
deep sandbank of Carsethorn was expected to arrest the career of these
desperate navigators; but they passed, with the celerity of water-fowl,
over an obstruction which had wrecked many pretty ships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old men shook their heads and departed, saying, &lsquo;We
have seen the fiend sailing in a bottomless ship; let us go home and
pray;&rsquo; but one young and wilful man said, &lsquo;Fiend!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll warrant it&rsquo;s nae fiend, but douce Janet Withershins
the witch, holding a carouse with some of her Cumberland cummers, and
mickle red wine will be spilt atween them.&nbsp; Dod I would gladly
have a toothfu&rsquo;!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll warrant it&rsquo;s nane o&rsquo;
your cauld sour slae-water like a bottle of Bailie Skrinkie&rsquo;s
port, but right drap-o&rsquo;-my-heart&rsquo;s-blood stuff, that would
waken a body out of their last linen.&nbsp; I wonder where the cummers
will anchor their craft?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll vow,&rsquo;
said another rustic, &lsquo;the wine they quaff is none of your visionary
drink, such as a drouthie body has dished out to his lips in a dream;
nor is it shadowy and unsubstantial, like the vessels they sail in,
which are made out of a cockel-shell or a cast-off slipper, or the paring
of a seaman&rsquo;s right thumb-nail.&nbsp; I once got a hansel out
of a witch&rsquo;s quaigh myself&mdash;auld Marion Mathers, of Dustiefoot,
whom they tried to bury in the old kirkyard of <!-- page 126--><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Dunscore;
but the cummer raise as fast as they laid her down, and naewhere else
would she lie but in the bonnie green kirkyard of Kier, among douce
and sponsible fowk.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;ll vow that the wine of a witch&rsquo;s
cup is as fell liquor as ever did a kindly turn to a poor man&rsquo;s
heart; and be they fiends, or be they witches, if they have red wine
asteer, I&rsquo;ll risk a drouket sark for ae glorious tout on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Silence, ye sinners,&rsquo; said the minister&rsquo;s
son of a neighbouring parish, who united in his own person his father&rsquo;s
lack of devotion with his mother&rsquo;s love of liquor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whist!&mdash;speak
as if ye had the fear of something holy before ye.&nbsp; Let the vessels
run their own way to destruction: who can stay the eastern wind, and
the current of the Solway sea?&nbsp; I can find ye Scripture warrant
for that; so let them try their strength on Blawhooly rocks, and their
might on the broad quicksand.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a surf running there
would knock the ribs together of a galley built by the imps of the pit,
and commanded by the Prince of Darkness.&nbsp; Bonnily and bravely they
sail away there, but before the blast blows by they&rsquo;ll be wrecked;
and red wine and strong brandy will be as rife as dyke-water, and we&rsquo;ll
drink the health of bonnie Bell Blackness out of her left-foot slipper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The speech of the young profligate was applauded by several
of his companions, and away they flew to the bay of Blawhooly, from
whence they <!-- page 127--><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>never
returned.&nbsp; The two vessels were observed all at once to stop in
the bosom of the bay, on the spot where their hulls now appear; the
mirth and the minstrelsy waxed louder than ever, and the forms of maidens,
with instruments of music and wine-cups in their hands, thronged the
decks.&nbsp; A boat was lowered; and the same shadowy pilot who conducted
the ships made it start towards the shore with the rapidity of lightning,
and its head knocked against the bank where the four young men stood
who longed for the unblest drink.&nbsp; They leaped in with a laugh,
and with a laugh were they welcomed on deck; wine-cups were given to
each, and as they raised them to their lips the vessels melted away
beneath their feet, and one loud shriek, mingled with laughter still
louder, was heard over land and water for many miles.&nbsp; Nothing
more was heard or seen till the morning, when the crowd who came to
the beach saw with fear and wonder the two Haunted Ships, such as they
now seem, masts and tackle gone; nor mark, nor sign, by which their
name, country, or destination could be known, was left remaining.&nbsp;
Such is the tradition of the mariners; and its truth has been attested
by many families whose sons and whose fathers have been drowned in the
haunted bay of Blawhooly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And trow ye,&rdquo; said the old woman, who, attracted from
her hut by the drowning cries of the young fisherman, had remained an
auditor of the <!-- page 128--><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>mariner&rsquo;s
legend,&mdash;&ldquo;And trow ye, Mark Macmoran, that the tale of the
Haunted Ships is done?&nbsp; I can say no to that.&nbsp; Mickle have
mine ears heard; but more mine eyes have witnessed since I came to dwell
in this humble home by the side of the deep sea.&nbsp; I mind the night
weel; it was on Hallowmas Eve; the nuts were cracked, and the apples
were eaten, and spell and charm were tried at my fireside; till, wearied
with diving into the dark waves of futurity, the lads and lasses fairly
took to the more visible blessings of kind words, tender clasps, and
gentle courtship.&nbsp; Soft words in a maiden&rsquo;s ear, and a kindly
kiss o&rsquo; her lip were old-world matters to me, Mark Macmoran; though
I mean not to say that I have been free of the folly of daunering and
daffin with a youth in my day, and keeping tryst with him in dark and
lonely places.&nbsp; However, as I say, these times of enjoyment were
passed and gone with me&mdash;the mair&rsquo;s the pity that pleasure
should fly sae fast away&mdash;and as I couldna make sport I thought
I should not mar any; so out I sauntered into the fresh cold air, and
sat down behind that old oak, and looked abroad on the wide sea.&nbsp;
I had my ain sad thoughts, ye may think, at the time: it was in that
very bay my blythe good-man perished, with seven more in his company;
and on that very bank where ye see the waves leaping and foaming, I
saw seven stately corses streeked, but the dearest was the eighth.&nbsp;
It was a woful <!-- page 129--><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>sight
to me, a widow, with four bonnie boys, with nought to support them but
these twa hands, and God&rsquo;s blessing, and a cow&rsquo;s grass.&nbsp;
I have never liked to live out of sight of this bay since that time;
and mony&rsquo;s the moonlight night I sit looking on these watery mountains
and these waste shores; it does my heart good, whatever it may do to
my head.&nbsp; So ye see it was Hallowmas Night, and looking on sea
and land sat I; and my heart wandering to other thoughts soon made me
forget my youthful company at hame.&nbsp; It might be near the howe
hour of the night.&nbsp; The tide was making, and its singing brought
strange old-world stories with it, and I thought on the dangers that
sailors endure, the fates they meet with, and the fearful forms they
see.&nbsp; My own blythe goodman had seen sights that made him grave
enough at times, though he aye tried to laugh them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aweel, atween that very rock aneath us and the coming tide,
I saw, or thought I saw&mdash;for the tale is so dreamlike that the
whole might pass for a vision of the night,&mdash;I saw the form of
a man; his plaid was grey, his face was grey; and his hair, which hung
low down till it nearly came to the middle of his back, was as white
as the white sea-foam.&nbsp; He began to howk and dig under the bank;
an&rsquo; God be near me, thought I, this maun be the unblessed spirit
of auld Adam Gowdgowpin the miser, who is doomed to dig for shipwrecked
treasure, <!-- page 130--><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>and count
how many millions are hidden for ever from man&rsquo;s enjoyment.&nbsp;
The form found something which in shape and hue seemed a left-foot slipper
of brass; so down to the tide he marched, and, placing it on the water,
whirled it thrice round, and the infernal slipper dilated at every turn,
till it became a bonnie barge with its sails bent, and on board leaped
the form, and scudded swiftly away.&nbsp; He came to one of the Haunted
Ships, and striking it with his oar, a fair ship, with mast and canvas
and mariners, started up; he touched the other Haunted Ship, and produced
the like transformation; and away the three spectre ships bounded, leaving
a track of fire behind them on the billows which was long unextinguished.&nbsp;
Now wasna that a bonnie and fearful sight to see beneath the light of
the Hallowmas moon?&nbsp; But the tale is far frae finished, for mariners
say that once a year, on a certain night, if ye stand on the Borran
Point, ye will see the infernal shallops coming snoring through the
Solway; ye will hear the same laugh and song and mirth and minstrelsy
which our ancestors heard; see them bound over the sandbanks and sunken
rocks like sea-gulls, cast their anchor in Blawhooly Bay, while the
shadowy figure lowers down the boat, and augments their numbers with
the four unhappy mortals to whose memory a stone stands in the kirkyard,
with a sinking ship and a shoreless sea cut upon it.&nbsp; Then the
spectre ships <!-- page 131--><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>vanish,
and the drowning shriek of mortals and the rejoicing laugh of fiends
are heard, and the old hulls are left as a memorial that the old spiritual
kingdom has not departed from the earth.&nbsp; But I maun away, and
trim my little cottage fire, and make it burn and blaze up bonnie, to
warm the crickets and my cold and crazy bones that maun soon be laid
aneath the green sod in the eerie kirkyard.&rdquo;&nbsp; And away the
old dame tottered to her cottage, secured the door on the inside, and
soon the hearth-flame was seen to glimmer and gleam through the keyhole
and window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye what,&rdquo; said the old mariner, in a
subdued tone, and with a shrewd and suspicious glance of his eye after
the old sibyl, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a word that may not very well be uttered,
but there are many mistakes made in evening stories if old Moll Moray
there, where she lives, knows not mickle more than she is willing to
tell of the Haunted Ships and their unhallowed mariners.&nbsp; She lives
cannily and quietly; no one knows how she is fed or supported; but her
dress is aye whole, her cottage ever smokes, and her table lacks neither
of wine, white and red, nor of fowl and fish, and white bread and brown.&nbsp;
It was a dear scoff to Jock Matheson, when he called old Moll the uncanny
carline of Blawhooly: his boat ran round and round in the centre of
the Solway&mdash;everybody said it was enchanted&mdash;and down it went
head foremost; and <!-- page 132--><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>hadna
Jock been a swimmer equal to a sheldrake, he would have fed the fish.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ll warrant it sobered the lad&rsquo;s speech; and he never
reckoned himself safe till he made old Moll the present of a new kirtle
and a stone of cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O father!&rdquo; said his granddaughter Barbara, &ldquo;ye
surely wrong poor old Mary Moray; what use could it be to an old woman
like her, who has no wrongs to redress, no malice to work out against
mankind, and nothing to seek of enjoyment save a canny hour and a quiet
grave&mdash;what use could the fellowship of fiends and the communion
of evil spirits be to her?&nbsp; I know Jenny Primrose puts rowan-tree
above the door-head when she sees old Mary coming; I know the good-wife
of Kittlenaket wears rowan-berry leaves in the headband of her blue
kirtle, and all for the sake of averting the unsonsie glance of Mary&rsquo;s
right ee; and I know that the auld Laird of Burntroutwater drives his
seven cows to their pasture with a wand of witch-tree, to keep Mary
from milking them.&nbsp; But what has all that to do with haunted shallops,
visionary mariners, and bottomless boats?&nbsp; I have heard myself
as pleasant a tale about the Haunted Ships and their unworldly crews
as any one would wish to hear in a winter evening.&nbsp; It was told
me by young Benjie Macharg, one summer night, sitting on Arbigland-bank:
the lad intended a sort of love meeting; but all that he could talk
of was about smearing sheep <!-- page 133--><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>and
shearing sheep, and of the wife which the Norway elves of the Haunted
Ships made for his uncle Sandie Macharg.&nbsp; And I shall tell ye the
tale as the honest lad told it to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexander Macharg, besides being the laird of three acres
of peatmoss, two kale gardens, and the owner of seven good milch cows,
a pair of horses, and six pet sheep, was the husband of one of the handsomest
women in seven parishes.&nbsp; Many a lad sighed the day he was brided;
and a Nithsdale laird and two Annandale moorland farmers drank themselves
to their last linen, as well as their last shilling, through sorrow
for her loss.&nbsp; But married was the dame; and home she was carried,
to bear rule over her home and her husband, as an honest woman should.&nbsp;
Now ye maun ken that though the flesh-and-blood lovers of Alexander&rsquo;s
bonnie wife all ceased to love and to sue her after she became another&rsquo;s,
there were certain admirers who did not consider their claim at all
abated, or their hopes lessened by the kirk&rsquo;s famous obstacle
of matrimony.&nbsp; Ye have heard how the devout minister of Tinwald
had a fair son carried away, and wedded against his liking to an unchristened
bride, whom the elves and the fairies provided; ye have heard how the
bonnie bride of the drunken Laird of Soukitup was stolen by the fairies
out at the back-window of the bridal chamber, the time the bridegroom
was groping his way to the chamber <!-- page 134--><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>door;
and ye have heard&mdash;but why need I multiply cases?&nbsp; Such things
in the ancient days were as common as candle-light.&nbsp; So ye&rsquo;ll
no hinder certain water elves and sea fairies, who sometimes keep festival
and summer mirth in these old haunted hulks, from falling in love with
the weel-faured wife of Laird Macharg; and to their plots and contrivances
they went how they might accomplish to sunder man and wife; and sundering
such a man and such a wife was like sundering the green leaf from the
summer, or the fragrance from the flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it fell on a time that Laird Macharg took his halve-net
on his back, and his steel spear in his hand, and down to Blawhooly
Bay gaed he, and into the water he went right between the two haunted
hulks, and placing his net awaited the coming of the tide.&nbsp; The
night, ye maun ken, was mirk, and the wind lowne, and the singing of
the increasing waters among the shells and the peebles was heard for
sundry miles.&nbsp; All at once light began to glance and twinkle on
board the two Haunted Ships from every hole and seam, and presently
the sound as of a hatchet employed in squaring timber echoed far and
wide.&nbsp; But if the toil of these unearthly workmen amazed the laird,
how much more was his amazement increased when a sharp shrill voice
called out, &lsquo;Ho, brother! what are you doing now?&rsquo;&nbsp;
A voice still shriller responded from the other haunted ship, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
making <!-- page 135--><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>a wife to
Sandie Macharg!&rsquo;&nbsp; And a loud quavering laugh running from
ship to ship, and from bank to bank, told the joy they expected from
their labour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the laird, besides being a devout and a God-fearing man,
was shrewd and bold; and in plot and contrivance, and skill in conducting
his designs, was fairly an overmatch for any dozen land elves; but the
water elves are far more subtle; besides their haunts and their dwellings
being in the great deep, pursuit and detection is hopeless if they succeed
in carrying their prey to the waves.&nbsp; But ye shall hear.&nbsp;
Home flew the laird, collected his family around the hearth, spoke of
the signs and the sins of the times, and talked of mortification and
prayer for averting calamity; and, finally, taking his father&rsquo;s
Bible, brass clasps, black print, and covered with calf-skin, from the
shelf, he proceeded without let or stint to perform domestic worship.&nbsp;
I should have told ye that he bolted and locked the door, shut up all
inlet to the house, threw salt into the fire, and proceeded in every
way like a man skilful in guarding against the plots of fairies and
fiends.&nbsp; His wife looked on all this with wonder; but she saw something
in her husband&rsquo;s looks that hindered her from intruding either
question or advice, and a wise woman was she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the mid-hour of the night the rush of a horse&rsquo;s
feet was heard, and the sound of a rider leaping from its back, and
a heavy knock came to <!-- page 136--><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>the
door, accompanied by a voice, saying, &lsquo;The cummer drink&rsquo;s
hot, and the knave bairn is expected at Laird Laurie&rsquo;s to-night;
sae mount, good-wife, and come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Preserve me!&rsquo; said the wife of Sandie Macharg,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s news indeed; who could have thought it?&nbsp; The
laird has been heirless for seventeen years!&nbsp; Now, Sandie, my man,
fetch me my skirt and hood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he laid his arm round his wife&rsquo;s neck, and said,
&lsquo;If all the lairds in Galloway go heirless, over this door threshold
shall you not stir to-night; and I have said, and I have sworn it; seek
not to know why or wherefore&mdash;but, Lord, send us thy blessed mornlight.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The wife looked for a moment in her husband&rsquo;s eyes, and desisted
from further entreaty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But let us send a civil message to the gossips, Sandy;
and hadna ye better say I am sair laid with a sudden sickness? though
it&rsquo;s sinful-like to send the poor messenger a mile agate with
a lie in his mouth without a glass of brandy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To such a messenger, and to those who sent him, no
apology is needed,&rsquo; said the austere laird; &lsquo;so let him
depart.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the clatter of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs was heard,
and the muttered imprecations of its rider on the churlish treatment
he had experienced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Sandie, my lad,&rsquo; said his wife, laying an
arm particularly white and round about his neck as she spoke, &lsquo;are
you not a queer man and a stern?&nbsp; <!-- page 137--><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>I
have been your wedded wife now these three years; and, beside my dower,
have brought you three as bonnie bairns as ever smiled aneath a summer
sun.&nbsp; O man, you a douce man, and fitter to be an elder than even
Willie Greer himself, I have the minister&rsquo;s ain word for &rsquo;t,
to put on these hard-hearted looks, and gang waving your arms that way,
as if ye said, &ldquo;I winna take the counsel of sic a hempie as you;&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m your ain leal wife, and will and maun have an explanation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To all this Sandie Macharg replied, &lsquo;It is written,
&ldquo;Wives, obey your husbands&rdquo;; but we have been stayed in
our devotion, so let us pray;&rsquo; and down he knelt: his wife knelt
also, for she was as devout as bonnie; and beside them knelt their household,
and all lights were extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now this beats a&rsquo;,&rsquo; muttered his wife to
herself; &lsquo;however, I shall be obedient for a time; but if I dinna
ken what all this is for before the morn by sunket-time, my tongue is
nae langer a tongue, nor my hands worth wearing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voice of her husband in prayer interrupted this mental
soliloquy; and ardently did he beseech to be preserved from the wiles
of the fiends and the snares of Satan; from witches, ghosts, goblins,
elves, fairies, spunkies, and water-kelpies; from the spectre shallop
of Solway; from spirits visible and invisible; from the Haunted Ships
and their unearthly tenants; from maritime spirits that plotted <!-- page 138--><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>against
godly men, and fell in love with their wives&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, but His presence be near us!&rsquo; said his wife,
in a low tone of dismay.&nbsp; &lsquo;God guide my gudeman&rsquo;s wits:
I never heard such a prayer from human lips before.&nbsp; But, Sandie,
my man, Lord&rsquo;s sake, rise.&nbsp; What fearful light is this?&nbsp;
Barn and byre and stable maun be in a blaze; and Hawkie, and Hurley,
Doddie, and Cherrie, and Damsonplum will be smoored with reek, and scorched
with flame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a flood of light, but not so gross as a common fire, which
ascended to heaven and filled all the court before the house, amply
justified the good-wife&rsquo;s suspicions.&nbsp; But to the terrors
of fire Sandie was as immovable as he was to the imaginary groans of
the barren wife of Laird Laurie; and he held his wife, and threatened
the weight of his right hand&mdash;and it was a heavy one&mdash;to all
who ventured abroad, or even unbolted the door.&nbsp; The neighing and
prancing of horses, and the bellowing of cows, augmented the horrors
of the night; and to any one who only heard the din, it seemed that
the whole onstead was in a blaze, and horses and cattle perishing in
the flame.&nbsp; All wiles, common or extraordinary, were put in practice
to entice or force the honest farmer and his wife to open the door;
and when the like success attended every new stratagem, silence for
a little while ensued, and a long, loud, and shrilling laugh wound up
the <!-- page 139--><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>dramatic efforts
of the night.&nbsp; In the morning, when Laird Macharg went to the door,
he found standing against one of the pilasters a piece of black ship
oak, rudely fashioned into something like human form, and which skilful
people declared would have been clothed with seeming flesh and blood,
and palmed upon him by elfin adroitness for his wife, had he admitted
his visitants.&nbsp; A synod of wise men and women sat upon the woman
of timber, and she was finally ordered to be devoured by fire, and that
in the open air.&nbsp; A fire was soon made, and into it the elfin sculpture
was tossed from the prongs of two pairs of pitchforks.&nbsp; The blaze
that arose was awful to behold; and hissings and burstings and loud
cracklings and strange noises were heard in the midst of the flame;
and when the whole sank into ashes, a drinking-cup of some precious
metal was found; and this cup, fashioned no doubt by elfin skill, but
rendered harmless by the purification with fire, the sons and daughters
of Sandie Macharg and his wife drink out of to this very day.&nbsp;
Bless all bold men, say I, and obedient wives!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 140--><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>THE BROWNIE.</h2>
<p>The Scottish Brownie formed a class of being distinct in habit and
disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves.&nbsp; He was meagre,
shaggy, and wild in his appearance.&nbsp; Thus Cleland, in his satire
against the Highlanders, compares them to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Faunes, or Brownies, if ye will,<br />
Or Satyres come from Atlas Hill.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the day-time he lurked in remote recesses of the old houses which
he delighted to haunt, and in the night sedulously employed himself
in discharging any laborious task which he thought might be acceptable
to the family to whose service he had devoted himself.&nbsp; But the
Brownie does not drudge from the hope of recompense.&nbsp; On the contrary,
so delicate is his attachment that the offer of reward, but particularly
of food, infallibly occasions his disappearance for ever.&nbsp; It is
told of a Brownie, who haunted a border family now extinct, that the
lady having fallen unexpectedly ill, and the servant, who was ordered
to ride to Jedburgh for the <i>sage-femme</i>, showing no great alertness
in setting out, <!-- page 141--><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>the
familiar spirit slipped on the greatcoat of the lingering domestic,
rode to the town on the laird&rsquo;s best horse, and returned with
the midwife <i>en croupe</i>.&nbsp; During the short space of his absence,
the Tweed, which they must necessarily ford, rose to a dangerous height.&nbsp;
Brownie, who transported his charge with all the rapidity of the ghostly
lover of Lenore, was not to be stopped by the obstacle.&nbsp; He plunged
in with the terrified old lady, and landed her in safety where her services
were wanted.&nbsp; Having put the horse into the stable (where it was
afterwards found in a woful plight), he proceeded to the room of the
servant, whose duty he had discharged, and finding him just in the act
of drawing on his boots, he administered to him a most merciless drubbing
with his own horsewhip.&nbsp; Such an important service excited the
gratitude of the laird, who, understanding that Brownie had been heard
to express a wish to have a green coat, ordered a vestment of the colour
to be made, and left in his haunts.&nbsp; Brownie took away the green
coat, but was never seen more.&nbsp; We may suppose that, tired of his
domestic drudgery, he went in his new livery to join the fairies.</p>
<p>The last Brownie known in Ettrick Forest resided in Bodsbeck, a wild
and solitary spot, near the head of Moffat Water, where he exercised
his functions undisturbed, till the scrupulous devotion of an old lady
induced her to &ldquo;hire him away,&rdquo; as it was <!-- page 142--><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>termed,
by placing in his haunt a porringer of milk and a piece of money.&nbsp;
After receiving this hint to depart, he was heard the whole night to
howl and cry, &ldquo;Farewell to bonnie Bodsbeck!&rdquo; which he was
compelled to abandon for ever.</p>
<h2><!-- page 143--><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>MAUNS&rsquo;
STANE.</h2>
<p>In the latter end of the autumn of 18--, I set out by myself on an
excursion over the northern part of Scotland, and during that time my
chief amusement was to observe the little changes of manners, language,
etc., in the different districts.&nbsp; After having viewed on my return
the principal curiosities in Buchan, I made a little ale-house, or &ldquo;public,&rdquo;
my head-quarters for the night.&nbsp; Having discussed my supper in
solitude, I called up mine host to enable me to discuss my bottle, and
to give me a statistical account of the country around me.&nbsp; Seated
in the &ldquo;blue&rdquo; end, and well supplied with the homely but
satisfying luxuries which the place afforded, I was in an excellent
mood for enjoying the communicativeness of my landlord; and, after speaking
about the cave of Slaines, the state of the crops, and the neighbouring
franklins, edged him, by degrees, to speak about the Abbey of Deer,
an interesting ruin which I had examined in the course of the day, formerly
the stronghold of the once powerful family of Cummin.</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
dootless a bonnie place about the abbey,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
naething like what it was when the great Sir James the Rose came to
hide i&rsquo; the Buchan woods wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; the Grahames rampagin&rsquo;
at his tail, whilk you that&rsquo;s a beuk-learned man &rsquo;ill hae
read o&rsquo;, an&rsquo; may be ye&rsquo;ll hae heard o&rsquo; the saughen
bush where he forgathered wi&rsquo; his jo; or aiblins ye may have seen
&rsquo;t, for it&rsquo;s standing yet just at the corner o&rsquo; gaukit
Jamie Jamieson&rsquo;s peat-stack.&nbsp; Ay, ay, the abbey was a brave
place once; but a&rsquo; thing, ye ken, comes till an end.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So saying, he nodded to me, and brought his glass to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place, then, must have been famed in days of yore, my
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye may tak my word for that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;&rsquo;Od,
it <i>was</i> a place!&nbsp; Sic a sight o&rsquo; fechtin&rsquo; as
they had about it!&nbsp; But gin ye&rsquo;ll gan up the trap-stair to
the laft, an&rsquo; open Jenny&rsquo;s kist, ye&rsquo;ll see sic a story
about it, printed by ane o&rsquo; your learned Aberdeen&rsquo;s fouk,
Maister Keith, I think; she coft it in Aberdeen for twal&rsquo; pennies,
lang ago, an&rsquo; battered it to the lid o&rsquo; her kist.&nbsp;
But gang up the stair canny, for fear that you should wauken her, puir
thing; or, bide, I&rsquo;ll just wauken Jamie Fleep, an&rsquo; gar him
help me down wi&rsquo;t, for our stair&rsquo;s no just that canny for
them &rsquo;t&rsquo;s no acquaint wi&rsquo;t, let alane a frail man
wi&rsquo; your infirmity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him that I would neither disturb the young lady&rsquo;s
slumber nor Jamie Fleep&rsquo;s, and begged <!-- page 145--><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>him
to give me as much information as he could about this castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, wishin&rsquo; your guid health again.&mdash;Our minister
ance said that Solomon&rsquo;s Temple was a&rsquo; in ruins, wi&rsquo;
whin bushes, an&rsquo; broom and thistles growin&rsquo; ower the bonnie
carved wark an&rsquo; the cedar wa&rsquo;s, just like our ain abbey.&nbsp;
Noo, I judge that the Abbey o&rsquo; Deer was just the marrow o &rsquo;t,
or the minister wadna hae said that.&nbsp; But when it was biggit, Lord
kens, for I dinna.&nbsp; It was just as you see it, lang afore your
honour was born, an&rsquo; aiblins, as the by-word says, may be sae
after ye&rsquo;re hanged.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.&nbsp;
The Cummins o&rsquo; Buchan were a dour and surly race; and, for a fearfu&rsquo;
time, nane near han&rsquo; nor far awa could ding them, an&rsquo; yet
mony a ane tried it.&nbsp; The fouk on their ain lan&rsquo; likit them
weel enough; but the Crawfords, an&rsquo; the Grahames, an&rsquo; the
Mars, an&rsquo; the Lovats, were aye trying to comb them against the
hair, an&rsquo; mony a weary kempin&rsquo; had they wi&rsquo; them.&nbsp;
But some way or ither they could never ding them; an&rsquo; fouk said
that they gaed and learned the black art frae the Pope o&rsquo; Room,
wha, I myself heard the minister say, had aye a colleague wi&rsquo;
the Auld Chiel.&nbsp; I dinna ken fou it was, in the tail o&rsquo; the
day, the hale country raise up against them, an&rsquo; besieged them
in the Abbey o&rsquo; Deer.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll see, my frien&rsquo;&rdquo;
(by this time mine host considered me as one of his cronies), &ldquo;tho&rsquo;
we ca&rsquo; it the abbey, it had naething to do wi&rsquo; <!-- page 146--><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>papistry;
na, na, no sae bad as a&rsquo; that either, but just a noble&rsquo;s
castle, where they keepit sodgers gaun about in airn an&rsquo; scarlet,
wi&rsquo; their swords an&rsquo; guns, an&rsquo; begnets, an&rsquo;
sentry-boxes, like the local militia in the barracks o&rsquo; Aberdeen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, ye see, they surrounded the castle, an&rsquo; lang did
they besiege it; but there was a vast o&rsquo; meat in the castle, an&rsquo;
the Buchan fouk fought like the vera deil.&nbsp; They took their horse
through a miscellaneous passage, half a mile long, aneath the hill o&rsquo;
Saplinbrae, an&rsquo; watered them in the burn o&rsquo; Pulmer.&nbsp;
But a&rsquo; wadna do; they took the castle at last, and a terrible
slaughter they made amo&rsquo; them; but they were sair disappointed
in ae partic&rsquo;ler, for Cummin&rsquo;s fouk sank a&rsquo; their
goud an&rsquo; siller in a draw-wall, an&rsquo; syne filled it up wi&rsquo;
stanes.&nbsp; They got naething in the way of spulzie to speak o&rsquo;;
sae out o&rsquo; spite they dang doon the castle, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
never been biggit to this day.&nbsp; But the Cummins were no sae bad
as the Lairds o&rsquo; Federat, after a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who were these Federats?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lairds o&rsquo; Federat?&rdquo; said he, moistening his
mouth again as a preamble to his oration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Troth, frae their
deeds ane would maist think that they had a drap o&rsquo; the deil&rsquo;s
blude, like the pyets.&nbsp; Gin a&rsquo; tales be true, they hae the
warmest place at his bink this vera minute.&nbsp; I dinna ken vera muckle
about them though, but the auldest fouk said they were just byous wi&rsquo;
cruelty.&nbsp; Mony a good man did <!-- page 147--><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>they

hear o&rsquo; Mauns&rsquo; Stane, neebour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mauns&rsquo; what?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ou, Mauns&rsquo; Stane.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s no likely.&nbsp;
Ye see it was just a queer clump o&rsquo; a roun&rsquo;-about heathen,
waghlin&rsquo; may be twa tons or thereby.&nbsp; It wasna like ony o&rsquo;
the stanes in our countra, an&rsquo; it was as roun&rsquo; as a fit-ba&rsquo;;
I&rsquo;m sure it wad ding Professor Couplan himsel&rsquo; to tell what
way it cam&rsquo; there.&nbsp; Noo, fouk aye thought there was something
uncanny about it, an&rsquo; some gaed the length o&rsquo; saying that
the deil used to bake ginshbread upon&rsquo;t; and, as sure as ye&rsquo;re
sitting there, frien&rsquo;, there was knuckle-marks upon &rsquo;t,
for my ain father has seen them as aften as I have taes an&rsquo; fingers.&nbsp;
Aweel, ye see, Mauns Crawford, the last o&rsquo; the Lairds o&rsquo;
Federat, an&rsquo; the deil had coost out (may be because the laird
was just as wicked an&rsquo; as clever as he was himsel&rsquo;), an&rsquo;
ye perceive the evil ane wantit to play him a trick.&nbsp; Noo, Mauns
Crawford was ae day lookin&rsquo; ower his castle wa&rsquo;, and he
saw a stalwart carle, in black claes, ridin&rsquo; up the loanin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
He stopped at this chuckie o&rsquo; a stane, an&rsquo; loutin&rsquo;
himsel&rsquo;, he took it up in his arms, and lifted it three times
to his saddle-bow, an&rsquo; syne he rade awa out o&rsquo; sight, never
comin&rsquo; near the castle, as Mauns thought he would hae done.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Noo,&rsquo; says the baron till himsel&rsquo;, says he, &lsquo;I
didna think that there was ony ane in a&rsquo; the land that could hae
<!-- page 148--><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>played sic a ploy;
but deil fetch me if I dinna lift it as weel as he did!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Sae aff he gaed, for there wasna sic a man for birr in a&rsquo; the
countra, an&rsquo; he kent it as weel, for he never met wi&rsquo; his
match.&nbsp; Weel, he tried, and tugged, and better than tugged at the
stane, but he coudna mudge it ava; an&rsquo; when he looked about, he
saw a man at his ilbuck, a&rsquo; smeared wi&rsquo; smiddy-coom, snightern
an&rsquo; laughin&rsquo; at him.&nbsp; The laird d---d him, an&rsquo;
bade him lift it, whilk he did as gin &rsquo;t had been a little pinnin.&nbsp;
The laird was like to burst wi&rsquo; rage at being fickled by sic a
hag-ma-hush carle, and he took to the stane in a fury, and lifted it
till his knee; but the weight o &rsquo;t amaist ground his banes to
smash.&nbsp; He held the stane till his een-strings crackit, when he
was as blin&rsquo; as a moudiwort.&nbsp; He was blin&rsquo; till the
day o&rsquo; his death,&mdash;that&rsquo;s to say, if ever he died,
for there were queer sayings about it&mdash;vera queer! vera queer!&nbsp;
The stane was ca&rsquo;d Mauns&rsquo; Stane ever after; an&rsquo; it
was no thought that canny to be near it after gloaming; for what says
the Psalm&mdash;hem!&mdash;I mean the sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tween Ennetbutts an&rsquo; Mauns&rsquo; Stane<br />
Ilka night there walks ane!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There never was a chief of the family after; the men were
scattered, an&rsquo; the castle demolished.&nbsp; The doo and the hoodie-craw
nestle i&rsquo; their towers, and the hare mak&rsquo;s her form on their

<p>&ldquo;Hoot, ay; mony a ane tried to find out whaur it was, and,

through the floor wi&rsquo; an awsome roar.&nbsp; I mysel&rsquo; have

<p>I assented to this, and quickly lost in sleep the remembrance of
all these tales of the olden times.</p>
<h2><!-- page 151--><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>&ldquo;HORSE
AND HATTOCK.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The power of the fairies was not confined to unchristened children
alone; it was supposed frequently to be extended to full-grown people,
especially such as in an unlucky hour were devoted to the devil by the
execrations of parents and of masters; or those who were found asleep
under a rock, or on a green hill, belonging to the fairies, after sunset,
or, finally, to those who unwarily joined their orgies.&nbsp; A tradition
existed, during the seventeenth century, concerning an ancestor of the
noble family of Duffers, who, &ldquo;walking abroad in the fields near
to his own house, was suddenly carried away, and found the next day
at Paris, in the French king&rsquo;s cellar, with a silver cup in his
hand.&nbsp; Being brought into the king&rsquo;s presence, and questioned
by him who he was, and how he came thither, he told his name, his country,
and the place of his residence, and that on such a day of the month,
which proved to be the day immediately preceding, being in the fields,
he heard a noise of a whirlwind, and of voices crying &lsquo;Horse and
hattock!&rsquo; (this is the word which <!-- page 152--><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the
fairies are said to use when they remove from any place), whereupon
he cried &lsquo;Horse and hattock!&rsquo; also, and was immediately
caught up and transported through the air by the fairies to that place,
where, after he had drunk heartily, he fell asleep, and before he woke
the rest of the company were gone, and had left him in the posture wherein
he was found.&nbsp; It is said the king gave him a cup which was found
in his hand, and dismissed him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The narrator affirms &ldquo;that
the cup was still preserved, and known by the name of the fairy cup.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He adds that Mr. Steward, tutor to the then Lord Duffers, had informed
him that, &ldquo;when a boy at the school of Forres, he and his school-fellows
were once upon a time whipping their tops in the churchyard, before
the door of the church, when, though the day was calm, they heard a
noise of a wind, and at some distance saw the small dust begin to rise
and turn round, which motion continued advancing till it came to the
place where they were, whereupon they began to bless themselves; but
one of their number being, it seems, a little more bold and confident
than his companion, said, &lsquo;Horse and hattock with my top!&rsquo;
and immediately they all saw the top lifted up from the ground, but
could not see which way it was carried, by reason of a cloud of dust
which was raised at the same time.&nbsp; They sought for the top all
about the place where it was taken up, but in vain; and it was found
afterwards in <!-- page 153--><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>the
churchyard, on the other side of the church.&rdquo;&nbsp; This legend
is contained in a letter from a learned gentleman in Scotland to Mr.
Aubrey, dated 15th March 1695, published in <i>Aubrey&rsquo;s Miscellanies</i>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 154--><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>SECRET COMMONWEALTH.</h2>
<p><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Robert Kirk</span>, <i>Minister
of Aberfoyle</i>, 1691.</p>
<p>The Siths, or Fairies, they call <i>Sluagh Maith</i>, or the Goodpeople,
it would seem, to prevent the dint of their ill attempts (for the Irish
used to bless all they fear harm of), and are said to be of a middle
nature betwixt man and angel, as were demons thought to be of old, of
intelligent studious spirits, and light changeable bodies (like those
called astral), somewhat of the nature of a condensed cloud, and best
seen in twilight.&nbsp; These bodies be so pliable through the subtlety
of the spirits that agitate them, that they can make them appear or
disappear at pleasure.&nbsp; Some have bodies or vehicles so spongeous,
thin, and defecat [pure] that they are fed by only sucking into some
fine spirituous liquors, that pierce like pure air and oil; others feed
more gross on the foyson [abundance] or substance of corn and liquors,
or corn itself that grows on the surface of the earth, which these fairies
steal away, partly invisible, partly preying on the grain, as do crows
<!-- page 155--><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>and mice; wherefore
in this same age they are sometimes heard to break bread, strike hammers,
and to do such like services within the little hillocks they most do
haunt; some whereof of old, before the Gospel dispelled Paganism, and
in some barbarous places as yet, enter houses after all are at rest,
and set the kitchens in order, cleansing all the vessels.&nbsp; Such
drags go under the name of Brownies.&nbsp; When we have plenty, they
have scarcity at their homes; and, on the contrary (for they are not
empowered to catch as much prey everywhere as they please), their robberies,
notwithstanding, ofttimes occasion great ricks of corn not to bleed
so well (as they call it), or prove so copious by very far as was expected
by the owner.</p>
<p>Their bodies of congealed air are sometimes carried aloft, other
whiles grovel in different shapes, and enter into any cranny or clift
of the earth where air enters, to their ordinary dwellings; the earth
being full of cavities and cells, and there being no place, no creature,
but is supposed to have other animals (greater or lesser) living in
or upon it as inhabitants; and no such thing as a pure wilderness in
the whole universe.</p>
<p>We then (the more terrestrial kind have now so numerously planted
all countries) do labour for that abstruse people, as well as for ourselves.&nbsp;
Albeit, when several countries were uninhabited by us, these had their
easy tillage above ground, as we <!-- page 156--><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>now.&nbsp;
The print of those furrows do yet remain to be seen on the shoulders
of very high hills, which was done when the campaign ground was wood
and forest.</p>
<p>They remove to other lodgings at the beginning of each quarter of
the year, so traversing till doomsday, being impotent of staying in
one place, and finding some ease by so purning [journeying] and changing
habitations.&nbsp; Their chameleon-like bodies swim in the air near
the earth with bag and baggage; and at such revolution of time, seers,
or men of the second sight (females being seldom so qualified) have
very terrifying encounters with them, even on highways; who, therefore,
awfully shun to travel abroad at these four seasons of the year, and
thereby have made it a custom to this day among the Scottish-Irish to
keep church duly every first Sunday of the quarter to <i>seun</i> or
hallow themselves, their corn and cattle, from the shots and stealth
of these wandering tribes; and many of these superstitious people will
not be seen in church again till the next quarter begins, as if no duty
were to be learnt or done by them, but all the use of worship and sermons
were to save them from these arrows that fly in the dark.</p>
<p>They are distributed in tribes and orders, and have children, nurses,
marriages, deaths, and burials in appearance, even as we (unless they
so do for a mock-show, or to prognosticate some such things among us).</p>
<p><!-- page 157--><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>They are clearly
seen by these men of the second sight to eat at funerals [and] banquets.&nbsp;
Hence many of the Scottish-Irish will not taste meat at these meetings,
lest they have communion with, or be poisoned by, them.&nbsp; So are
they seen to carry the bier or coffin with the corpse among the middle-earth
men to the grave.&nbsp; Some men of that exalted sight (whether by art
or nature) have told me they have seen at these meetings a double man,
or the shape of some man in two places; that is a super-terranean and
a subterranean inhabitant, perfectly resembling one another in all points,
whom he, notwithstanding, could easily distinguish one from another
by some secret tokens and operations, and so go and speak to the man,
his neighbour and familiar, passing by the apparition or resemblance
of him.&nbsp; They avouch that every element and different state of
being has animals resembling those of another element; as there be fishes
sometimes at sea resembling monks of late order in all their hoods and
dresses; so as the Roman invention of good and bad demons, and guardian
angels particularly assigned, is called by them an ignorant mistake,
sprung only from this original.&nbsp; They call this reflex man a co-walker,
every way like the man, as a twin brother and companion, haunting him
as his shadow, as is oft seen and known among men (resembling the original),
both before and after the original is dead; and was often seen of old
to enter a house, by which <!-- page 158--><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>the
people knew that the person of that likeness was to visit them within
a few days.&nbsp; This copy, echo, or living picture, goes at last to
his own herd.&nbsp; It accompanied that person so long and frequently
for ends best known to itself, whether to guard him from the secret
assaults of some of its own folk, or only as a sportful ape to counterfeit
all his actions.&nbsp; However, the stories of old witches prove beyond
contradiction that all sorts of people, spirits which assume light airy
bodies, or crazed bodies coacted by foreign spirits, seem to have some
pleasure (at least to assuage some pain or melancholy) by frisking and
capering like satyrs, or whistling and screeching (like unlucky birds)
in their unhallowed synagogues and Sabbaths.&nbsp; If invited and earnestly
required, these companions make themselves known and familiar to men;
otherwise, being in a different state and element, they neither can
nor will easily converse with them.&nbsp; They avouch that a <i>heluo</i>
or great eater has a voracious elve to be his attender, called a joint-eater
or just-halver, feeding on the pith and quintessence of what the man
eats; and that, therefore, he continues lean like a hawk or heron, notwithstanding
his devouring appetite; yet it would seem they convey that substance
elsewhere, for these subterraneans eat but little in their dwellings,
their food being exactly clean, and served up by pleasant children,
like enchanted puppets.</p>
<p>Their houses are called large and fair, and (unless <!-- page 159--><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>at
some odd occasions) unperceivable by vulgar eyes, like Rachland and
other enchanted islands, having fir lights, continual lamps, and fires,
often seen without fuel to sustain them.&nbsp; Women are yet alive who
tell they were taken away when in childbed to nurse fairy children,
a lingering voracious image of them being left in their place (like
their reflection in a mirror), which (as if it were some insatiable
spirit in an assumed body) made first semblance to devour the meats
that it cunningly carried by, and then left the carcass as if it expired
and departed thence by a natural and common death.&nbsp; The child and
fire, with food and all other necessaries, are set before the nurse
how soon she enters, but she neither perceives any passage out, nor
sees what those people do in other rooms of the lodging.&nbsp; When
the child is weaned, the nurse dies, or is conveyed back, or gets it
to her choice to stay there.&nbsp; But if any superterraneans be so
subtle as to practise sleights for procuring the privacy to any of their
mysteries (such as making use of their ointments, which, as Gyges&rsquo;
ring, make them invisible or nimble, or cast them in a trance, or alter
their shape, or make things appear at a vast distance, etc.), they smite
them without pain, as with a puff of wind, and bereave them of both
the natural and acquired sights in the twinkling of an eye (both these
sights, when once they come, being in the same organ and inseparable),
or they strike <!-- page 160--><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>them
dumb.&nbsp; The tramontanes to this day place bread, the Bible, or a
piece of iron, to save their women at such times from being thus stolen,
and they commonly report that all uncouth, unknown wights are terrified
by nothing earthly so much as cold iron.&nbsp; They deliver the reason
to be that hell lying betwixt the chill tempests and the firebrands
of scalding metals, and iron of the north (hence the loadstone causes
a tendency to that point), by an antipathy thereto, these odious, far-scenting
creatures shrug and fright at all that comes thence relating to so abhorred
a place, whence their torment is either begun, or feared to come hereafter.</p>
<p>Their apparel and speech is like that of the people and country under
which they live; so are they seen to wear plaids and variegated garments
in the Highlands of Scotland, and suanachs [plaids] therefore in Ireland.&nbsp;
They speak but little, and that by way of whistling, clear, not rough.&nbsp;
The very devils conjured in any country do answer in the language of
the place; yet sometimes the subterraneans speak more distinctly than
at other times.&nbsp; Their women are said to spin very fine, to dye,
to tossue, and embroider; but whether it be as manual operation of substantial
refined stuffs, with apt and solid instruments, or only curious cobwebs,
unpalpable rainbows, and a phantastic imitation of the actions of more
terrestrial mortals, since it transcended <!-- page 161--><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>all
the senses of the seer to discern whether, I leave to conjecture as
I found it.</p>
<p>Their men travel much abroad, either presaging or aping the dismal
and tragical actions of some amongst us; and have also many disastrous
doings of their own, as convocations, fighting, gashes, wounds, and
burials, both in the earth and air.&nbsp; They live much longer than
we; yet die at last, or [at] least vanish from that state.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
one of their tenets that nothing perisheth, but (as the sun and year)
everything goes in a circle, lesser or greater, and is renewed and refreshed
in its revolutions; as &rsquo;tis another, that every body in the creation
moves (which is a sort of life); and that nothing moves but has another
animal moving on it; and so on, to the utmost minutest corpuscle that&rsquo;s
capable of being a receptacle of life.</p>
<p>They are said to have aristocratical rulers and laws, but no discernible
religion, love, or devotion towards God, the blessed Maker of all: they
disappear whenever they hear His name invoked, or the name of Jesus
(at which all do bow willingly, or by constraint, that dwell above or
beneath, within the earth), (Philip, ii. 10); nor can they act ought
at that time after hearing of that sacred name.&nbsp; The Taiblsdear
or seer, that corresponds with this kind of familiars, can bring them
with a spell to appear to himself or others when he pleases, as readily
as Endor Witch did those of her own <!-- page 162--><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>kind.&nbsp;
He tells they are ever readiest to go on hurtful errands, but seldom
will be the messengers of great good to men.&nbsp; He is not terrified
with their sight when he calls them, but seeing them in a surprise (as
often as he does) frights him extremely, and glad would he be quit of
such, for the hideous spectacles seen among them; as the torturing of
some wight, earnest, ghostly, staring looks, skirmishes, and the like.&nbsp;
They do not all the harm which appearingly they have power to do; nor
are they perceived to be in great pain, save that they are usually silent
and sullen.&nbsp; They are said to have many pleasant toyish books;
but the operation of these pieces only appears in some paroxysms of
antic, corybantic jollity, as if ravished and prompted by a new spirit
entering into them at that instant, lighter and merrier than their own.&nbsp;
Other books they have of involved, abstruse sense, much like the Rosurcian
[Rosicrucian] style.&nbsp; They have nothing of the Bible, save collected
parcels for charms and counter-charms; not to defend themselves withal,
but to operate on other animals, for they are a people invulnerable
by our weapons, and albeit werewolves&rsquo; and witches&rsquo; true
bodies are (by the union of the spirit of nature that runs through all
echoing and doubling the blow towards another) wounded at home, when
the astral assumed bodies are stricken elsewhere&mdash;as the strings
of a second harp, tuned to a unison, sound, though only one be <!-- page 163--><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>struck,&mdash;yet
these people have not a second, or so gross a body at all, to be so
pierced; but as air which when divided unites again; or if they feel
pain by a blow, they are better physicians than we, and quickly cure.&nbsp;
They are not subject to sore sicknesses, but dwindle and decay at a
certain period, all about an age.&nbsp; Some say their continual sadness
is because of their pendulous state (like those men, Luke xiii. 2-6),
as uncertain what at the last revolution will become of them, when they
are locked up into an unchangeable condition; and if they have any frolic
fits of mirth, &rsquo;tis as the constrained grinning of a mort-head
[death&rsquo;s-head], or rather as acted on a stage, and moved by another,
ther [than?] cordially coming of themselves.&nbsp; But other men of
the second sight, being illiterate, and unwary in their observations,
learn from [differ from] those; one averring those subterranean people
to be departed souls, attending a while in this inferior state, and
clothed with bodies procured through their alms-deeds in this life;
fluid, active, ethereal vehicles to hold them that they may not scatter
nor wander, and be lost in the totum, or their first nothing; but if
any were so impious as to have given no alms, they say, when the souls
of such do depart, they sleep in an inactive state till they resume
the terrestrial bodies again; others, that what the low-country Scotch
call a wraith, and the Irish <i>taibhse</i>, or death&rsquo;s messenger
(appearing sometimes <!-- page 164--><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>as
a little rough dog, and if crossed and conjured in time, will be pacified
by the death of any other creature instead of the sick man), is only
exuvious fumes of the man approaching death, exhaled and congealed into
a various likeness (as ships and armies are sometimes shaped in the
air), and called astral bodies, agitated as wild-fire with wind, and
are neither souls nor counterfeiting spirits; yet not a few avouch (as
is said) that surely these are a numerous people by themselves, having
their own politics, which diversities of judgment may occasion several
inconsonancies in this rehearsal, after the narrowest scrutiny made
about it.</p>
<p>Their weapons are most-what solid earthly bodies, nothing of iron,
but much of stone, like to yellow soft flint spa, shaped like a barbed
arrowhead, but flung like a dart, with great force.&nbsp; These arms
(cut by art and tools, it seems, beyond human) have somewhat of the
nature of thunderbolt subtlety, and mortally wounding the vital parts
without breaking the skin; of which wounds I have observed in beasts,
and felt them with my hands.&nbsp; They are not as infallible Benjamites,
hitting at a hair&rsquo;s-breadth; nor are they wholly unvanquishable,
at least in appearance.</p>
<p>The men of the second sight do not discover strange things when asked,
but at fits and raptures, as if inspired with some genius at that instant,
which before did work in or about them.&nbsp; Thus I <!-- page 165--><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>have
frequently spoken to one of them, who in his transport told me he cut
the body of one of those people in two with his iron weapon, and so
escaped this onset, yet he saw nothing left behind of that appearing
divided; at other times he outwrested [wrestled?] some of them.&nbsp;
His neighbours often perceived this man to disappear at a certain place,
and about an hour after to become visible, and discover himself near
a bow-shot from the first place.&nbsp; It was in that place where he
became invisible, said he, that the subterraneans did encounter and
combat with him.&nbsp; Those who are <i>unseund</i>, or unsanctified
(called fey), are said to be pierced or wounded with those people&rsquo;s
weapons, which makes them do somewhat very unlike their former practice,
causing a sudden alteration, yet the cause thereof unperceivable at
present; nor have they power (either they cannot make use of their natural
powers, or asked not the heavenly aid) to escape the blow impendent.&nbsp;
A man of the second sight perceived a person standing by him (sound
to other&rsquo;s view) wholly gored in blood, and he (amazed like) bid
him instantly flee.&nbsp; The whole man laughed at his <i>airt</i> [notice]
and warning, since there was no appearance of danger.&nbsp; He had scarce
contracted his lips from laughter when unexpectedly his enemies leaped
in at his side and stabbed him with their weapons.&nbsp; They also pierce
cows or other animals, usually said to be Elf-shot, whose purest <!-- page 166--><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>substance
(if they die) these subterraneans take to live on, viz. the a&euml;rial
and ethereal parts, the most spirituous matter for prolonging of life,
such as aquavit&aelig; (moderately taken) is amongst liquors, leaving
the terrestrial behind.&nbsp; The cure of such hurts is only for a man
to find out the hole with his finger, as if the spirits flowing from
a man&rsquo;s warm hand were antidote sufficient against their poisoned
darts.</p>
<p>As birds, as beasts, whose bodies are much used to the change of
the free and open air, foresee storms, so those invisible people are
more sagacious to understand by the books of nature things to come,
than we, who are pestered with the grossest dregs of all elementary
mixtures, and have our purer spirits choked by them.&nbsp; The deer
scents out a man and powder (though a late invention) at a great distance;
a hungry hunter, bread; and the raven, a carrion; their brains, being
long clarified by the high and subtle air, will observe a very small
change in a trice.&nbsp; Thus a man of the second sight, perceiving
the operations of these forecasting invisible people among us (indulged
through a stupendous providence to give warnings of some remarkable
events, either in the air, earth, or waters), told he saw a winding
shroud creeping on a walking healthful person&rsquo;s leg till it came
to the knee, and afterwards it came up to the middle, then to the shoulders,
and at last over the head, which was <!-- page 167--><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>visible
to no other person.&nbsp; And by observing the spaces of time betwixt
the several stages, he easily guessed how long the man was to live who
wore the shroud; for when it approached the head, he told that such
a person was ripe for the grave.</p>
<p>There be many places called fairy-hills, which the mountain people
think impious and dangerous to peel or discover, by taking earth or
wood from them, superstitiously believing the souls of their predecessors
to dwell there.&nbsp; And for that end (say they) a mole or mound was
dedicate beside every churchyard to receive the souls till their adjacent
bodies arise, and so became as a fairy-hill; they using bodies of air
when called abroad.&nbsp; They also affirm those creatures that move
invisibly in a house, and cast huge great stones, but do no much hurt,
because counter-wrought by some more courteous and charitable spirits
that are everywhere ready to defend men (Dan. x. 13), to be souls that
have not attained their rest, through a vehement desire of revealing
a murder or notable injury done or received, or a treasure that was
forgot in their lifetime on earth, which, when disclosed to a conjuror
alone, the ghost quite removes.</p>
<p>In the next country to that of my former residence, about the year
1676, when there was some scarcity of grain, a marvellous illapse and
vision strongly struck the imagination of two women in one night, living
at a good distance from one <!-- page 168--><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>another,
about a treasure hid in a hill called <i>Sith-bruthach</i>, or fairy-hill.&nbsp;
The appearance of a treasure was first represented to the fancy, and
then an audible voice named the place where it was to their awaking
senses.&nbsp; Whereupon both rose, and meeting accidentally at the place,
discovered their design; and jointly digging, found a vessel as large
as a Scottish peck full of small pieces of good money, of ancient coin;
and halving betwixt them, they sold in dishfuls for dishfuls of meal
to the country people.&nbsp; Very many of undoubted credit saw and had
of the coin to this day.&nbsp; But whether it was a good or bad angel,
one of the subterranean people, or the restless soul of him who hid
it, that discovered it, and to what end it was done, I leave to the
examination of others.</p>
<p>These subterraneans have controversies, doubts, disputes, feuds,
and siding of parties; there being some ignorance in all creatures,
and the vastest created intelligences not compassing all things.&nbsp;
As to vice and sin, whatever their own laws be, sure according to ours,
and equity, natural, civil, and revealed, they transgress and commit
acts of injustice and sin by what is above said, as to their stealing
of nurses to their children, and that other sort of plaginism in catching
our children away (may seem to heir some estate in those invisible dominions)
which never return.&nbsp; For swearing and intemperance, they are not
observed so subject to those <!-- page 169--><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>irregularities,
as to envy, spite, hypocrisy, lying, and dissimulation.</p>
<p>As our religion obliges us not to make a peremptory and curious search
into these abstrusenesses, so the histories of all ages give as many
plain examples of extraordinary occurrences as make a modest inquiry
not contemptible.&nbsp; How much is written of pigmies, fairies, nymphs,
syrens, apparitions, which though not the tenth part true, yet could
not spring of nothing; even English authors relate [of] Barry Island,
in Glamorganshire, that laying your ear into a cleft of the rocks, blowing
of bellows, striking of hammers, clashing of armour, filing of iron,
will be heard distinctly ever since Merlin enchanted those subterranean
wights to a solid manual forging of arms to Aurelius Ambrosius and his
Britons, till he returned; which Merlin being killed in a battle, and
not coming to loose the knot, these active vulcans are there tied to
a perpetual labour.</p>
<h2><!-- page 170--><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>THE FAIRY BOY
OF LEITH.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;About fifteen years since, having business that detained me
for some time at Leith, which is near Edinburgh, in the kingdom of Scotland,
I often met some of my acquaintance at a certain house there, where
we used to drink a glass of wine for our refection.&nbsp; The woman
which kept the house was of honest reputation among the neighbours,
which made me give the more attention to what she told me one day about
a fairy boy (as they called him) who lived about that town.&nbsp; She
had given me so strange an account of him, that I desired her I might
see him the first opportunity, which she promised; and not long after,
passing that way, she told me there was the fairy boy, but a little
before I came by; and, casting her eye into the street, said, &lsquo;Look
you, sir, yonder he is, at play with those other boys&rsquo;; and pointing
him out to me, I went, and by smooth words, and a piece of money, got
him to come into the house with me; where, in the presence of divers
people, I demanded of him several astrological questions, which he answered
<!-- page 171--><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>with great subtlety;
and, through all his discourse, carried it with a cunning much above
his years, which seemed not to exceed ten or eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to make a motion like drumming upon the table with
his fingers, upon which I asked him whether he could beat a drum?&nbsp;
To which he replied, &lsquo;Yes, sir, as well as any man in Scotland;
for every Thursday night I beat all points to a sort of people that
used to meet under yonder hill&rsquo; (pointing to the great hill between
Edinburgh and Leith).&nbsp; &lsquo;How, boy?&rsquo; quoth I, &lsquo;what
company have you there?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;There are, sir,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;a great company both of men and women, and they are entertained
with many sorts of music besides my drum; they have, besides, plenty
of variety of meats and wine, and many times we are carried into France
or Holland in the night, and return again, and whilst we are there,
we enjoy all the pleasures the country doth afford.&rsquo;&nbsp; I demanded
of him how they got under that hill?&nbsp; To which he replied that
there was a great pair of gates that opened to them, though they were
invisible to others, and that within there were brave large rooms, as
well accommodated as most in Scotland.&nbsp; I then asked him how I
should know what he said to be true?&nbsp; Upon which he told me he
would read my fortune, saying, I should have two wives, and that he
saw the forms of them over my shoulders; and both would be very handsome
women.</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>&ldquo;The woman
of the house told me that all the people in Scotland could not keep
him from the rendezvous on Thursday night; upon which, by promising
him some more money, I got a promise of him to meet me at the same place
in the afternoon, the Thursday following, and so dismissed him at that
time.&nbsp; The boy came again at the place and time appointed, and
I had prevailed with some friends to continue with me (if possible)
to prevent his moving that night.&nbsp; He was placed between us, and
answered many questions, until, about eleven of the clock, he was got
away unperceived by the company; but I, suddenly missing him, hastened
to the door, and took hold of him, and so returned him into the same
room.&nbsp; We all watched him, and, of a sudden, he was again got out
of doors; I followed him close, and he made a noise in the street, as
if he had been set upon, and from that time I could never see him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 173--><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>THE DRAC&AElig;.</h2>
<p>These are a sort of water-spirits who inveigle women and children
into the recesses which they inhabit, beneath lakes and rivers, by floating
past them, on the surface of the water, in the shape of gold rings or
cups.&nbsp; The women thus seized are employed as nurses, and after
seven years are permitted to revisit earth.&nbsp; Gervase mentions one
woman in particular who had been allured by observing a wooden dish,
or cup, float by her, while she was washing clothes in the river.&nbsp;
Being seized as soon as she reached the depths, she was conducted into
one of the subterranean recesses, which she described as very magnificent,
and employed as nurse to one of the brood of the hag who had allured
her.&nbsp; During her residence in this capacity, having accidentally
touched one of her eyes with an ointment of serpent&rsquo;s grease,
she perceived, at her return to the world, that she had acquired the
faculty of seeing the <i>Drac&aelig;</i>, when they intermingle themselves
with men.&nbsp; Of this power she was, however, deprived by the touch
of her ghostly mistress, <!-- page 174--><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>whom
she had one day incautiously addressed.&nbsp; It is a curious fact that
this story, in almost all its parts, is current in both the Highlands
and Lowlands of Scotland, with no other variation than the substitution
of Fairies for Drac&aelig;, and the cavern of a hill for that of a river.&nbsp;
Indeed many of the vulgar account it extremely dangerous to touch anything
which they may happen to find without saining (blessing) it, the snares
of the enemy being notorious and well-attested.&nbsp; A pool-woman of
Teviotdale having been fortunate enough, as she thought herself, to
find a wooden beetle, at the very time when she needed such an implement,
seized it without pronouncing a proper blessing, and, carrying it home,
laid it above her bed to be ready for employment in the morning.&nbsp;
At midnight the window of her cottage opened, and a loud voice was heard
calling up some one within by a strange and uncouth name.&nbsp; The
terrified cottager ejaculated a prayer, which, we may suppose, ensured
her personal safety; while the enchanted implement of housewifery, tumbling
from the bedstead, departed by the window with no small noise and precipitation.&nbsp;
In a humorous fugitive tract, Dr. Johnson has been introduced as disputing
the authenticity of an apparition, merely because the spirit assumed
the shape of a teapot and a shoulder of mutton.&nbsp; No doubt, a case
so much in point as that we have now quoted would have removed his incredulity.</p>
<h2><!-- page 175--><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>A SUCCINCT ACCOUNT<br />
OF<br />
MY LORD TARBAT&rsquo;S RELATIONS,<br />
IN A LETTER TO THE HONORABLE ROBERT BOYLE,<br />
ESQUIRE, OF THE PREDICTIONS MADE BY<br />
SEERS, WHEREOF HIMSELF WAS EAR-AND EYE-WITNESS.</h2>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I heard very much, but believed very little of the second
sight; yet its being assumed by several of great veracity, I was induced
to make inquiry after it in the year 1652, being then confined in the
north of Scotland by the English usurpers.&nbsp; The more general accounts
of it were that many Highlanders, yet far more Islanders, were qualified
with this second sight; and men, women, and children, indistinctly,
were subject to it, and children where parents were not.&nbsp; Sometimes
people came to age who had it not when young, nor could any tell by
what means produced.&nbsp; It is a trouble to most of them who are subject
to it, and they would be rid of it at any rate if they could.&nbsp;
The sight is of no <!-- page 176--><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>long
duration, only continuing so long as they can keep their eyes steady
without twinkling.&nbsp; The hardy, therefore, fix their look that they
may see the longer; but the timorous see only glances&mdash;their eyes
always twinkle at the first sight of the object.&nbsp; That which generally
is seen by them are the species of living creatures, and of inanimate
things, which be in motion, such as ships, and habits upon persons.&nbsp;
They never see the species of any person who is already dead.&nbsp;
What they foresee fails not to exist in the mode, and in that place
where it appears to them.&nbsp; They cannot well know what space of
time shall intervene between the apparition and the real existence.&nbsp;
But some of the hardiest and longest experience have some rules for
conjectures; as, if they see a man with a shrouding sheet in the apparition,
they will conjecture at the nearness or remoteness of his death by the
more or less of his body that is covered by it.&nbsp; They will ordinarily
see their absent friends, though at a great distance, sometimes no less
than from America to Scotland, sitting, standing, or walking in some
certain place; and then they conclude with an assurance that they will
see them so, and there.&nbsp; If a man be in love with a woman, they
will ordinarily see the species of that man standing by her, and so
likewise if a woman be in love.&nbsp; If they see the species of any
person who is sick to die, they see them covered over with the shrouding
sheet.</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>These generals
I had verified to me by such of them as did see, and were esteemed honest
and sober by all the neighbourhood; for I inquired after such for my
information.&nbsp; And because there were more of these seers in the
isles of Lewis, Harris, and Uist than in any other place, I did entreat
Sir James M&rsquo;Donald (who is now dead), Sir Normand M&rsquo;Loud,
and Mr. Daniel Morison, a very honest person (who are still alive),
to make inquiry in this uncouth sight, and to acquaint me therewith;
which they did, and all found an agreement in these generals, and informed
me of many instances confirming what they said.&nbsp; But though men
of discretion and honour, being but at second-hand, I will choose rather
to put myself than my friends on the hazard of being laughed at for
incredible relations.</p>
<p>I was once travelling in the Highlands, and a good number of servants
with me, as is usual there; and one of them, going a little before me,
entering into a house where I was to stay all night, and going hastily
to the door, he suddenly slipped back with a screech, and did fall by
a stone, which hit his foot.&nbsp; I asked what the matter was, for
he seemed to be very much frighted.&nbsp; He told me very seriously
that I should not lodge in that house, because shortly a dead coffin
would be carried out of it, for many were carrying of it when he was
heard cry.&nbsp; I, neglecting his words, and staying there, he said
to other of his servants he was sorry for it, and that surely what <!-- page 178--><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>he
saw would shortly come to pass.&nbsp; Though no sick person was then
there, yet the landlord, a healthy Highlander, died of an apoplectic
fit before I left the house.</p>
<p>In the year 1653 Alexander Monro (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel to
the Earl of Dumbarton&rsquo;s regiment) and I were walking in a place
called Ullapool, in Loch Broom, on a little plain at the foot of a rugged
hill.&nbsp; There was a servant walking with a spade in the walk before
us; his back was to us, and his face to the hill.&nbsp; Before we came
to him he let the spade fall, and looked toward the hill.&nbsp; He took
notice of us as we passed near by him, which made me look at him, and
perceiving him to stare a little strangely I conjectured him to be a
seer.&nbsp; I called at him, at which he started and smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
are you doing?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; He answered, &ldquo;I have seen
a very strange thing: an army of Englishmen, leading of horses, coming
down that hill; and a number of them are coming down to the plain, and
eating the barley which is growing in the field near to the hill.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was on the 4th May (for I noted the day), and it was four or five
days before the barley was sown in the field he spoke of.&nbsp; Alexander
Monro asked him how he knew they were Englishmen.&nbsp; He said because
they were leading of horses, and had on hats and boots, which he knew
no Scotchman would have there.&nbsp; We took little notice of the whole
story as other than a <!-- page 179--><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>foolish
vision, but wished that an English party were there, we being then at
war with them, and the place almost inaccessible for horsemen.&nbsp;
But in the beginning of August thereafter, the Earl of Middleton (then
Lieutenant for the King in the Highlands), having occasion to march
a party of his towards the South Highlands, he sent his Foot through
a place called Inverlawell; and the fore-party, which was first down
the hill, did fall off eating the barley which was on the little plain
under it.&nbsp; And Monro calling to mind what the seer told us in May
preceding, he wrote of it, and sent an express to me to Lochslin, in
Ross (where I then was), with it.</p>
<p>I had occasion once to be in company where a young lady was (excuse
my not naming of persons), and I was told there was a notable seer in
the company.&nbsp; I called him to speak with me, as I did ordinarily
when I found any of them; and after he had answered me several questions,
I asked if he knew any person to be in love with that lady.&nbsp; He
said he did, but he knew not the person; for, during the two days he
had been in her company, he perceived one standing near her, and his
head leaning on her shoulder, which he said did foretell that the man
should marry her, and die before her, according to his observation.&nbsp;
This was in the year 1655.&nbsp; I desired him to describe the person,
which he did, so that I could conjecture, by the description, <!-- page 180--><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>of
such a one, who was of that lady&rsquo;s acquaintance, though there
were no thoughts of their marriage till two years thereafter.&nbsp;
And having occasion in the year 1657 to find this seer, who was an islander,
in company with the other person whom I conjectured to have been described
by him, I called him aside, and asked if that was the person he saw
beside the lady near two years then past.&nbsp; He said it was he indeed,
for he had seen that lady just then standing by him hand in hand.&nbsp;
This was some few months before their marriage, and that man is now
dead, and the lady alive.</p>
<p>I shall trouble you but with one more, which I thought most remarkable
of any that occurred to me.</p>
<p>In January 1652, the above-mentioned Lieutenant, Colonel Alex. Monro,
and I, happened to be in the house of one William M&rsquo;Clend, of
Ferrinlea, in the county of Ross.&nbsp; He, the landlord, and I, were
sitting in three chairs near the fire, and in the corner of the great
chimney there were two islanders, who were that very night come to the
house, and were related to the landlord.&nbsp; While the one of them
was talking with Monro, I perceived the other to look oddly toward me.&nbsp;
From this look, and his being an islander, I conjectured him a seer,
and asked him at what he stared.&nbsp; He answered by desiring me to
rise from that chair, for it was an unlucky one.&nbsp; I asked him why?&nbsp;
He answered, <!-- page 181--><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>because
there was a dead man in the chair next to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;if it be in the next chair, I may keep my own.&nbsp;
But what is the likeness of the man?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he was a tall
man, with a long grey coat, booted, and one of his legs hanging over
the arm of the chair, and his head hanging dead to the other side, and
his arm backward, as if it was broken.&nbsp; There were some English
troops then quartered near that place, and there being at that time
a great frost after a thaw, the country was covered all over with ice.&nbsp;
Four or five of the English riding by this house some two hours after
the vision, while we were sitting by the fire, we heard a great noise,
which proved to be those troopers, with the help of other servants,
carrying in one of their number, who had got a very mischievous fall,
and had his arm broke; and falling frequently in swooning fits, they
brought him into the hall, and set him in the very chair, and in the
very posture that the seer had prophesied.&nbsp; But the man did not
die, though he recovered with great difficulty.</p>
<p>Among the accounts given me by Sir Normand M&rsquo;Loud, there was
one worthy of special notice, which was thus:&mdash;There was a gentleman
in the Isle of Harris, who was always seen by the seers with an arrow
in his thigh.&nbsp; Such in the Isle who thought those prognostications
infallible, did not doubt but he would be shot in the thigh before he
died.&nbsp; Sir Normand told me that he heard it the <!-- page 182--><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>subject
of their discourse for many years.&nbsp; At last he died without any
such accident.&nbsp; Sir Normand was at his burial at St. Clement&rsquo;s
Church in the Harris.&nbsp; At the same time the corpse of another gentleman
was brought to be buried in the same very church.&nbsp; The friends
on either side came to debate who should first enter the church, and,
in a trice, from words they came to blows.&nbsp; One of the number (who
was armed with bow and arrows) let one fly among them.&nbsp; (Now every
family in that Isle have their burial-place in the Church in stone chests,
and the bodies are carried in open biers to the burial-place.)&nbsp;
Sir Normand having appeased the tumult, one of the arrows was found
shot in the dead man&rsquo;s thigh.&nbsp; To this Sir Normand was a
witness.</p>
<p>In the account which Mr. Daniel Morison, parson in the Lewis, gave
me, there was one, though it be heterogeneous from the subject, yet
it may be worth your notice.&nbsp; It was of a young woman in this parish,
who was mightily frightened by seeing her own image still before her,
always when she came to the open air; the back of the image being always
to her, so that it was not a reflection as in a mirror, but the species
of such a body as her own, and in a very like habit which appeared to
herself continually before her.&nbsp; The parson kept her a long while
with him, but had no remedy of her evil, which troubled her exceedingly.&nbsp;
I was told afterwards that when she was four or five years older she
saw it not.</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>These are matters
of fact, which I assure you they are truly related.&nbsp; But these
and all others that occurred to me, by information or otherwise, could
never lead me into a remote conjecture of the cause of so extraordinary
a phenomenon.&nbsp; Whether it be a quality in the eyes of some people
in these parts, concurring with a quality in the air also; whether such
species be everywhere, though not seen by the want of eyes so qualified,
or from whatever other cause, I must leave to the inquiry of clearer
judgments than mine.&nbsp; But a hint may be taken from this image which
appeared still to this woman above mentioned, and from another mentioned
by Aristotle, in the fourth of his Metaphysics (if I remember right,
for it is long since I read it), as also from the common opinion that
young infants (unsullied with many objects) do see apparitions which
were not seen by those of elder years; as likewise from this, that several
did see the second sight when in the Highlands or Isles, yet when transported
to live in other countries, especially in America, they quite lose this
quality, as was told me by a gentleman who knew some of them in Barbadoes,
who did see no vision there, although he knew them to be seers when
they lived in the Isles of Scotland.</p>
<p><i>Thus far my Lord Tarbat</i>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 184--><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>THE BOGLE.</h2>
<p>This is a freakish spirit who delights rather to perplex and frighten
mankind than either to serve or seriously hurt them.&nbsp; The <i>Esprit
Follet</i> of the French, Shakespeare&rsquo;s Puck, or Robin Goodfellow,
and Shellycoat, a spirit who resides in the waters, and has given his
name to many a rock and stone on the Scottish coast, belong to the class
of bogles.&nbsp; One of Shellycoat&rsquo;s pranks is thus narrated:&mdash;Two
men in a very dark night, approaching the banks of the Ettrick, heard
a doleful voice from its waves repeatedly exclaim, &ldquo;Lost! lost!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They followed the sound, which seemed to be the voice of a drowning
person, and, to their astonishment, found that it ascended the river;
still they continued to follow the cry of the malicious sprite, and,
arriving before dawn at the very sources of the river, the voice was
now heard descending the opposite side of the mountain in which they
arise.&nbsp; The fatigued and deluded travellers now relinquished the
pursuit, and had no sooner done so, than they heard Shellycoat applauding,
in loud bursts of laughter, his successful roguery.</p>
<h2><!-- page 185--><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>DAOINE SHIE,
OR THE MEN OF PEACE.</h2>
<p>They are, though not absolutely malevolent, believed to be a peevish,
repining, and envious race, who enjoy, in the subterranean recesses,
a kind of shadowy splendour.&nbsp; The Highlanders are at all times
unwilling to speak of them, but especially on Friday, when their influence
is supposed to be particularly extensive.&nbsp; As they are supposed
to be invisibly present, they are at all times to be spoken of with
respect.&nbsp; The fairies of Scotland are represented as a diminutive
race of beings, of a mixed or rather dubious nature, capricious in their
dispositions, and mischievous in their resentment.&nbsp; They inhabit
the interior of green hills, chiefly those of a conical form, in Gaelic
termed <i>Sighan</i>, on which they lead their dances by moonlight,
impressing upon the surface the marks of circles, which sometimes appear
yellow and blasted, sometimes of a deep green hue, and within which
it is dangerous to sleep, or to be found after sunset.&nbsp; The removal
of those large portions of turf, which thunderbolts sometimes scoop
out of the ground with singular regularity, is also ascribed to their
agency.&nbsp; Cattle <!-- page 186--><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>which
are suddenly seized with the cramp, or some similar disorder, are said
to be elf-shot, and the approved cure is to chafe the parts affected
with a blue bonnet, which, it may be readily believed, often restores
the circulation.&nbsp; The triangular flints frequently found in Scotland,
with which the ancient inhabitants probably barbed their shafts, are
supposed to be the weapons of fairy resentment, and are termed elf arrowheads.&nbsp;
The rude brazen battle-axes of the ancients, commonly called &ldquo;celts,&rdquo;
are also ascribed to their manufacture.&nbsp; But, like the Gothic duergar,
their skill is not confined to the fabrication of arms; for they are
heard sedulously hammering in linns, precipices, and rocky or cavernous
situations, where, like the dwarfs of the mines mentioned by George
Agricola, they busy themselves in imitating the actions and the various
employments of men.&nbsp; The Brook of Beaumont, for example, which
passes in its course by numerous linns and caverns, is notorious for
being haunted by the fairies; and the perforated and rounded stones
which are formed by trituration in its channels are termed by the vulgar
fairy cups and dishes.&nbsp; A beautiful reason is assigned by Fletcher
for the fays frequenting streams and fountains.&nbsp; He tells us of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A virtuous well, about whose flowery banks<br />
The nimble-footed fairies dance their rounds<br />
By the pale moonshine, dipping oftentimes<br />
Their stolen children, so to make them free<br />
From dying flesh and dull mortality.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 187--><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>It is sometimes
accounted unlucky to pass such places without performing some ceremony
to avert the displeasure of the elves.&nbsp; There is upon the top of
Minchmuir, a mountain in Peeblesshire, a spring called the Cheese Well,
because, anciently, those who passed that way were wont to throw into
it a piece of cheese as an offering to the fairies, to whom it was consecrated.</p>
<p>Like the <i>feld elfen</i> of the Saxons, the usual dress of the
fairies is green; though, on the moors, they have been sometimes observed
in heath-brown, or in weeds dyed with the stone-raw or lichen.&nbsp;
They often ride in invisible procession, when their presence is discovered
by the shrill ringing of their bridles.&nbsp; On these occasions they
sometimes borrow mortal steeds, and when such are found at morning,
panting and fatigued in their stalls, with their manes and tails dishevelled
and entangled, the grooms, I presume, often find this a convenient excuse
for their situation, as the common belief of the elves quaffing the
choicest liquors in the cellars of the rich might occasionally cloak
the delinquencies of an unfaithful butler.</p>
<p>The fairies, besides their equestrian processions, are addicted,
it would seem, to the pleasures of the chase.&nbsp; A young sailor,
travelling by night from Douglas, in the Isle of Man, to visit his sister
residing in Kirk Merlugh, heard a noise of horses, the holloa of a huntsman,
and the sound of a horn.&nbsp; <!-- page 188--><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Immediately
afterwards, thirteen horsemen, dressed in green, and gallantly mounted,
swept past him.&nbsp; Jack was so much delighted with the sport that
he followed them, and enjoyed the sound of the horn for some miles,
and it was not till he arrived at his sister&rsquo;s house that he learned
the danger which he had incurred.&nbsp; I must not omit to mention that
these little personages are expert jockeys, and scorn to ride the little
Manx ponies, though apparently well suited to their size.&nbsp; The
exercise, therefore, falls heavily upon the English and Irish horses
brought into the Isle of Man.&nbsp; Mr. Waldron was assured by a gentleman
of Ballafletcher that he had lost three or four capital hunters by these
nocturnal excursions.&nbsp; From the same author we learn that the fairies
sometimes take more legitimate modes of procuring horses.&nbsp; A person
of the utmost integrity informed him that, having occasion to sell a
horse, he was accosted among the mountains by a little gentleman plainly
dressed, who priced his horse, cheapened him, and, after some chaffering,
finally purchased him.&nbsp; No sooner had the buyer mounted and paid
the price than he sank through the earth, horse and man, to the astonishment
and terror of the seller, who, experienced, however, no inconvenience
from dealing with so extraordinary a purchaser.</p>
<h2><!-- page 189--><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>THE DEATH &ldquo;BREE.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>There was once a woman, who lived in the Camp-del-more of Strathavon,
whose cattle were seized with a murrain, or some such fell disease,
which ravaged the neighbourhood at the time, carrying off great numbers
of them daily.&nbsp; All the forlorn fires and hallowed waters failed
of their customary effects; and she was at length told by the wise people,
whom she consulted on the occasion, that it was evidently the effect
of some infernal agency, the power of which could not be destroyed by
any other means than the never-failing specific&mdash;the juice of a
dead head from the churchyard,&mdash;a nostrum certainly very difficult
to be procured, considering that the head must needs be abstracted from
the grave at the hour of midnight.&nbsp; Being, however, a woman of
a stout heart and strong faith, native feelings of delicacy towards
the sanctuary of the dead had more weight than had fear in restraining
her for some time from resorting to this desperate remedy.&nbsp; At
length, seeing that her stock would soon be annihilated by the destructive
career <!-- page 190--><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>of the disease,
the wife of Camp-del-more resolved to put the experiment in practice,
whatever the result might be.&nbsp; Accordingly, having with considerable
difficulty engaged a neighbouring woman as her companion in this hazardous
expedition, they set out a little before midnight for the parish churchyard,
distant about a mile and a half from her residence, to execute her determination.&nbsp;
On arriving at the churchyard her companion, whose courage was not so
notable, appalled by the gloomy prospect before her, refused to enter
among the habitations of the dead.&nbsp; She, however, agreed to remain
at the gate till her friend&rsquo;s business was accomplished.&nbsp;
This circumstance, however, did not stagger the wife&rsquo;s resolution.&nbsp;
She, with the greatest coolness and intrepidity, proceeded towards what
she supposed an old grave, took down her spade, and commenced her operations.&nbsp;
After a good deal of toil she arrived at the object of her labour.&nbsp;
Raising the first head, or rather skull, that came in her way, she was
about to make it her own property, when a hollow, wild, sepulchral voice
exclaimed, &ldquo;That is my head; let it alone!&rdquo;&nbsp; Not wishing
to dispute the claimant&rsquo;s title to this head, and supposing she
could be otherwise provided, she very good-naturedly returned it and
took up another.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is my father&rsquo;s head,&rdquo;
bellowed the same voice.&nbsp; Wishing, if possible, to avoid disputes,
the wife of Camp-del-more took up another head, when the <!-- page 191--><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>same
voice instantly started a claim to it as his grandfather&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the wife, nettled at her disappointments,
&ldquo;although it were your grandmother&rsquo;s head, you shan&rsquo;t
get it till I am done with it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you say,
you limmer?&rdquo; says the ghost, starting up in his awry habiliments.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you say, you limmer?&rdquo; repeated he in a great rage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the great oath, you had better leave my grandfather&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon matters coming this length, the wily wife of
Camp-del-more thought it proper to assume a more conciliatory aspect.&nbsp;
Telling the claimant the whole particulars of the predicament in which
she was placed, she promised faithfully that if his honour would only
allow her to carry off his grandfather&rsquo;s skull or head in a peaceable
manner, she would restore it again when done with.&nbsp; Here, after
some communing, they came to an understanding; and she was allowed to
take the head along with her, on condition that she should restore it
before cock-crowing, under the heaviest penalties.</p>
<p>On coming out of the churchyard and looking for her companion, she
had the mortification to find her &ldquo;without a mouthful of breath
in her body&rdquo;; for, on hearing the dispute between her friend and
the guardian of the grave, and suspecting much that she was likely to
share the unpleasant punishments with which he threatened her friend,
at the bare recital of them she fell down in a faint, from <!-- page 192--><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>which
it was no easy matter to recover her.&nbsp; This proved no small inconvenience
to Camp-del-more&rsquo;s wife, as there were not above two hours to
elapse ere she had to return the head according to the terms of her
agreement.&nbsp; Taking her friend upon her back, she carried her up
a steep acclivity to the nearest adjoining house, where she left her
for the night; then repaired home with the utmost speed, made <i>dead
bree</i> of the head ere the appointed time had expired, restored the
skull to its guardian, and placed the grave in its former condition.&nbsp;
It is needless to add that, as a reward for her exemplary courage, the
&ldquo;<i>bree</i>&rdquo; had its desired effect.&nbsp; The cattle speedily
recovered, and, so long as she retained any of it, all sorts of diseases
were of short duration.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
